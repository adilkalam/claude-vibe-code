# Claude Code Setup

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-19
**Status:** Optimized for Vibe Coding

---

# Introduction

This reference documents a comprehensive Claude Code setup optimized for "vibe coding"—AI-assisted development where you describe what you want and AI handles the implementation details.

## What are Agents, Skills, Plugins, and MCPs?

**Agents** are specialized AI assistants with specific expertise (e.g., frontend-developer, code-reviewer). When you use the Task tool in Claude Code, you can invoke these agents to handle specific jobs. They're installed via package managers like Leamas and are standalone—not bundled in plugins.

```typescript
// Invoke an agent to handle a specific task
Task({ subagent_type: "frontend-developer", prompt: "Build a responsive navbar component" })
// → Dispatches frontend-developer agent to create the component with best practices
```

**Skills** are process frameworks and workflows that guide how tasks should be done (e.g., test-driven-development, brainstorming). They're activated automatically when relevant or via the Skill tool. Skills come bundled in plugins.

```typescript
// Explicitly invoke a skill to guide your process
Skill({ command: "superpowers:brainstorming" })
// → Launches Socratic refinement process before writing any code
```

**Plugins** are packages that provide collections of skills. They're enabled in your Claude Code settings and provide additional capabilities like superpowers (systematic workflows) or seo-content-creation (SEO tools).

```json
// Enable plugins in ~/.claude/settings.json
{
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "superpowers@superpowers-marketplace": true
  }
}
// → Makes all superpowers skills available (TDD, debugging, code review, etc.)
```

**MCPs (Model Context Protocol servers)** extend Claude's capabilities with external tools and data sources. They run as background services and provide additional functions like memory systems or structured reasoning.

```json
// Configure MCPs in ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]
    }
  }
}
// → Enables structured reasoning for complex problem-solving
```
