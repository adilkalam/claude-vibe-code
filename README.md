## How Claude Code Works

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    CLAUDE CODE ECOSYSTEM                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘


MARKETPLACE FLOW
────────────────

🏪 MARKETPLACE
   │  Collection of related plugins
   │  Examples: superpowers-marketplace, claude-code-workflows
   ↓
🔧 PLUGIN
   │  Bundle of skills (or agents in SEO case)
   │  Enabled in: ~/.claude/settings.json
   │  Format: "plugin-name@marketplace-name"
   ↓
⚡ SKILL
   │  Workflow framework that guides how Claude works
   │  Auto-triggers OR slash commands
   │
   Examples:
   • brainstorming → Socratic questioning before design
   • test-driven-development → Write tests first
   • requesting-code-review → Spawn code-reviewer


AGENT KIT FLOW
───────────────

📦 AGENT KIT
   │  Installed via CLI (I use Leamas)
   │  Command: ~/leamas/leamas agent@kit-name
   ↓
🤖 AGENT
   │  Fresh Claude instance with domain expertise
   │  Auto-invoked OR called via Task()
   │
   Examples:
   • frontend-developer → Builds React components
   • ui-designer → Creates design systems
   • code-reviewer → Reviews code quality

MCP FLOW
────────

🔌 MCP SERVER
   │  External service (NOT AI)
   │  Configured in: claude_desktop_config.json
   ↓
🛠️ TOOL/CAPABILITY
   │  Claude queries these for enhanced capabilities
   │
   Examples:
   • sequential-thinking → Step-by-step reasoning
   • playwright → Browser automation
```

## Example: How Tools Work Together

```
USER: "Add authentication to my app"
  │
  ▼ Claude analyzes → Identifies: auth, OAuth, sessions
  │
  ├─ ⚡ brainstorming
  │  └─ Socratic questions: OAuth providers? Password reset? Sessions?
  │
  ├─ ⚡ test-driven-development
  │  └─ Write failing tests: login✗ logout✗ OAuth✗
  │
  ├─ Parallel execution ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  🤖 frontend-developer       🤖 database-admin          📦 context7        │
  │     Build login UI              Create users table         Lookup Auth0/   │
  │     (React + TypeScript)        (oauth, sessions)          Supabase docs   │
  │
  ├─ ⚡ requesting-code-review
  │  └─ Spawn code-reviewer agent: Check SQL injection, auth bypass
  │
  ├─ ⚡ verification-before-completion
  │  └─ Run tests: login✓ logout✓ OAuth✓

  ✅ Feature complete & secure
```

## Installation

### How to Install Agents

I use **Leamas** to install agent kits. Each kit bundles multiple related agents.

```bash
# Install Leamas (if not already installed)
# Visit: https://leamas.sh/

# Install agent kits I use:
~/leamas/leamas agent@claude-code-sub-agents  # 6 development agents
~/leamas/leamas agent@wshobson                # 10 vibe coding + utility agents
```

**Available Agent Kits:**
- `claude-code-sub-agents` — 6 agents (ui-designer, ux-designer, frontend-developer, ios-developer, code-reviewer, prompt-engineer)
- `wshobson` — 10 agents (agent-organizer, vibe-coding-coach, context-manager, nextjs-pro, data-scientist, quant-analyst, python-pro, database-admin, database-optimizer, payment-integration)



  
### How to Get Plugin Marketplaces

# Plugins: Marketplaces for Skills

To find plugins and their associated skills, type /plugins into Claude Code

```yaml
/plugins
 1. Command Recognition:  Claude Code detects the /plugins slash command
 2. Marketplace Loading:  The system reads ~/.claude/settings.json to see which plugins are enabled
 3. Plugin Discovery: Scans ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/ directories for installed plugin definitions
 4. Activation — Each enabled plugin's manifest is loaded, which contains:
    - Skills (workflow instructions)
    - Agents (specialized AI definitions)
    - Slash commands (custom commands)
    - MCP integrations (if any)
  5. Context Injection: Skills become available for auto-triggering or manual invocation
  6. Agent Registration: Agents become available via Task({ subagent_type: "agent-name" })
  7. Command Registration: Slash commands become available in the command palette
```

## How to Enable Plugins:
