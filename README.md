This setup is optimized for "vibe coding"—a development approach where:
1. You describe what you want in natural language
2. AI handles the implementation details
3. You focus on design decisions and high-level architecture
4. Systematic workflows (TDD, code review, debugging) are built-in

No manual code manipulation. Just vibes and results.
