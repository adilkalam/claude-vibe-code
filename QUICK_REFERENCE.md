## 🔄 Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Add a New Feature

```
1. /orca "Add [feature name]"
   └─ Auto-detects project type
   └─ Dispatches: requirement-analyst → system-architect
   └─ Implementation agents in parallel
   └─ test-engineer writes tests
   └─ quality-validator verifies

2. Review evidence
   └─ Screenshots (UI changes)
   └─ Test output (functionality)
   └─ Build logs (compilation)

3. Done!
```

---

### Workflow 2: Fix a Bug

```
1. Describe the problem naturally
   "The login button doesn't work on mobile"

2. Auto-orchestration:
   └─ Appropriate agent investigates
   └─ Identifies root cause
   └─ Implements fix
   └─ test-engineer adds regression test
   └─ quality-validator verifies

3. Evidence provided:
   └─ Before/after screenshots
   └─ Test showing bug is fixed
```

---

### Workflow 3: Design Exploration

```
1. /concept "Dashboard with analytics"
   └─ Studies reference examples
   └─ Extracts design patterns
   └─ Brainstorms approach
   └─ Gets your approval

2. Once approved, /orca executes
   └─ design-engineer creates design system
   └─ frontend-engineer implements
   └─ test-engineer validates
   └─ quality-validator checks a11y

3. /visual-review for final check
```

---

### Workflow 4: Performance Investigation

```
1. /ultra-think "Why is the app slow?"
   └─ Deep analysis (no code changes)
   └─ Identifies bottlenecks
   └─ Provides recommendations

2. Review recommendations

3. /orca "Implement [specific optimization]"
   └─ Appropriate agents implement
   └─ test-engineer benchmarks
   └─ Evidence shows improvement
```

---

### Workflow 5: Iterative Feedback

```
1. Work gets completed

2. /agentfeedback "The spacing is too tight and colors are off"
   └─ Parses into actionable points:
      a) Increase spacing
      b) Adjust colors
   └─ Dispatches design-engineer
   └─ Updates with evidence

3. Optionally: /agentfeedback --learn
   └─ Extracts design rules
   └─ Prevents repeated mistakes
```

## 🪝 Auto-Orchestration Hook

**File:** `hooks/detect-project-type.sh`

**Runs:** Every session start (< 50ms)

**Does:**
1. Checks for project markers (*.xcodeproj, package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
2. Detects project type
3. Loads appropriate agent team
4. Sets evidence requirements
5. Writes `.claude-orchestration-context.md`

**Install:**
```bash
cp hooks/detect-project-type.sh ~/.claude/hooks/
chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/detect-project-type.sh
```

**Configure in `.claude/settings.local.json`:**
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash ~/.claude/hooks/detect-project-type.sh 2>/dev/null || echo '# Auto-Orchestration: Detection failed'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

│  │
│  ├─ Simple/focused?
│  │  └─ Use: /enhance (smart task execution)
│  │
│  └─ Complex/multi-step?
│     └─ Use: /orca (full orchestration)
│
└─ Is it design-related?
   ├─ Exploration: /concept
   ├─ Inspiration: /inspire or /save-inspiration

## 💡 Pro Tips

**1. Trust Auto-Detection**
- The hook detects your project type automatically
- Loads the right agent team
- Just describe what you want

**2. Use Evidence**
- Screenshots for UI changes
- Test output for functionality
- Build logs for compilation
- No evidence = not done

**3. Leverage Parallel Execution**
- /orca dispatches multiple agents simultaneously
- 3-5x faster than sequential
- Same cost, better results

**4. Save Feedback as Rules**
- /agentfeedback --learn extracts design rules
- Prevents repeating mistakes
- Builds personal design language

**5. Browse the Repo**
- All agents in `agents/*/`
- All commands in `commands/`
- Easy to reference and edit
