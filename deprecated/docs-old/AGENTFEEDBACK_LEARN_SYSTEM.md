# /agentfeedback --learn System

**Created:** 2025-10-21
**Purpose:** Automated design rule extraction and enforcement to prevent repeated violations

---

## The Problem This Solves

### Before This System

**Repeated corrections:**
- "Supreme LL 300 again - I've told you 3 times it must be 400"
- "You didn't study the anti-aging reference page BEFORE building (2nd time explaining this)"
- "Discovery scope too narrow - asked for 100+ diverse examples, got 12 documentation sites"

**Manual enforcement:**
- User has to catch every typography violation
- User has to explain same workflow rules repeatedly
- No learning from frustration patterns
- Rules exist in design system docs but aren't automatically enforced

**Result:** Wasted time, frustration, repeated mistakes

### After This System

**Automated learning:**
- System detects repeated corrections ("again", "3rd time", "still seeing...")
- Extracts structured rules from feedback
- Stores permanently in DESIGN_RULES.md
- Auto-enforces based on adherence level

**Adaptive enforcement:**
- Level 5: Zero deviation (strict MVP compliance)
- Level 1: Creative freedom (minimal rules)
- Rules flex based on creative constraints

**Result:** Mistakes caught BEFORE presenting to user

## How It Works

### Overview

```
User Feedback with --learn
         ‚Üì
    Analyze Patterns
  (repeated violations?)
         ‚Üì
   Extract Rules
 (typography, spacing,
  workflow, etc.)
         ‚Üì
  Store in DESIGN_RULES.md
  (with adherence levels)
         ‚Üì
Future Design/UX Work
         ‚Üì
   Interactive Workflow
  (find, ask, approve)
         ‚Üì
  Get Adherence Levels
  (design 1-5, inspiration 1-5)
         ‚Üì
   Build with Agents
  (agents know rules)
         ‚Üì
   Automated Validation
  (grep checks, build verify)
         ‚Üì
  Rules Enforced Based on Level
  (strict at 5, flexible at 1)
         ‚Üì
   Present Work
 (violations caught early)
```

### Two-Dimensional Creative Control

**Design Guide Adherence (1-5):** How strictly follow YOUR design system?
- 5 = ZERO deviation (MVP, speed, strict compliance)
- 4 = Colors only (can experiment with palette)
- 3 = Colors + Typography (can play with fonts)
- 2 = Significant freedom (colors + typography + spacing + layouts)
- 1 = Go nuts (maximum creative exploration)

**Inspiration Adherence (1-5):** How closely follow EXTERNAL examples?
- 5 = Copy exactly (pixel-perfect)
- 4 = Follow closely (layout/structure)
- 3 = Take pattern (make it your own)
- 2 = Study concept (apply differently)
- 1 = Just for taste (inform thinking)

### Example Combinations

**Design: 5, Inspiration: 1**
‚Üí "Follow OUR rules strictly, browse examples for aesthetic taste only"
‚Üí Use case: MVP that needs to ship fast

**Design: 1, Inspiration: 5**
‚Üí "Break our rules, copy this example exactly"
‚Üí Use case: Found perfect reference, want that exact UX

**Design: 3, Inspiration: 3**
‚Üí "Moderate flexibility on both"
‚Üí Use case: Take approach from examples, adapt to our style

## Usage

### Basic Workflow (Without --learn)

```bash
# User provides feedback
/agentfeedback The sticky nav blocks content, timeline is unreadable

# System:
# 1. Parses feedback
# 2. Categorizes issues
# 3. Assigns agents
# 4. Orchestrates fixes
# 5. Quality gates
# 6. Re-presents work
```

### Enhanced Workflow (With --learn)

```bash
# User provides feedback with --learn flag
/agentfeedback --learn You used Supreme LL 300 again - 3rd time I've told you
it must be 400. Also didn't study references before building.

# System additionally:
# 1. Detects repeated violations ("again", "3rd time")
# 2. Extracts structured rules:
#    - Typography: Supreme LL ONLY 400 weight
#    - Workflow: Study references BEFORE building
# 3. Stores in DESIGN_RULES.md with adherence levels
# 4. Creates automated validation checks
# 5. Tracks violation occurrences
# 6. Shows user what was learned
# 7. Proceeds with normal feedback processing
```

### Interactive Workflow for Design/UX Work

When design/UX issues are detected, system asks:

**Question 1:** "Found similar pages - use as reference?"
- Shows found examples
- User chooses which to follow

**Question 2:** "Provide inspiration via /inspire?"
- User can add examples to gallery
- Or proceed with existing knowledge

**Question 3:** "Design guide adherence (1-5)?"
- User sets strictness level
- Determines which rules apply

**Question 4:** "Inspiration adherence (1-5)?"
- User sets how closely to follow examples
- From pixel-perfect to taste-only

---

## Rule Extraction

### What Gets Extracted

**Typography Rules:**
- Font families and authorized usage
- Weight restrictions (e.g., "Supreme LL ONLY 400")
- Minimum/maximum sizes
- Color token requirements

**Spacing Rules:**
- Grid system (e.g., "4px grid, var(--space-X) only")
- No arbitrary pixel values
- Padding/margin standards

**Workflow Rules:**
- Required steps before building
- Discovery research requirements
- Approval gates
- Reference study mandates

**Information Architecture:**
- Content hierarchy principles
- Progressive disclosure patterns
- "Hero" content placement

**Code Quality:**
- Build requirements
- Testing standards
- Review processes

### Adherence Level Annotations

Each rule specifies which adherence levels it applies to:

```markdown
### Supreme LL Font Weight
**Applies to:** Levels 5-3 (strict enforcement)

**Rule:** Supreme LL may ONLY use weight 400 (NEVER 300)

**Adherence flexibility:**
- Levels 5-3: STRICT (must use 400)
- Levels 2-1: Can explore weights but must justify
```

**Workflow rules apply to ALL levels** (non-negotiable process).

---

## Automated Validation

### Grep-Based Checks

System generates automated validation for each rule:

```bash
# Typography: Supreme LL 300 check
grep -rE 'Supreme.*300|font-weight: 300' **/*.css **/*.module.css
# Expected: 0 matches
# Applies to: Levels 5-3

# Spacing: Arbitrary values check
grep -rE 'padding: [0-9]+px' **/*.css | grep -v 'var(--space'
# Expected: 0 matches
# Applies to: Levels 5-3

# Colors: Hardcoded values check
grep -rE 'rgba\(|#[0-9a-fA-F]{3,6}' **/*.css | grep -v 'var(--color'
# Expected: 0 matches
# Applies to: Levels 5-4
```

### Adherence-Aware Enforcement

```bash
ADHERENCE_LEVEL=5

# Run checks based on level
if [ "$ADHERENCE_LEVEL" -ge 3 ]; then
  # Strict typography enforcement
  violations=$(grep -rE 'font-weight: 300' app/ | wc -l)
  if [ "$violations" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "‚ùå VALIDATION FAILED: Typography violations"
    exit 1
  fi
fi

if [ "$ADHERENCE_LEVEL" -ge 4 ]; then
  # Strict color enforcement
  violations=$(grep -rE '#[0-9a-fA-F]{6}' app/ | grep -v 'var(--color' | wc -l)
  if [ "$violations" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "‚ùå VALIDATION FAILED: Color violations"
    exit 1
  fi
fi
```

### Workflow Checks

Manual verification required:
- Evidence of searching for similar pages?
- Evidence of studying references?
- Showed concept before building?
- Got user approval on approach?

### [Rule Name]
**Applies to:** Levels X-Y
**Added:** [date] (violation occurred N times)
**Rule:** [Description]
**Validation:** [bash check]
**Adherence flexibility:** [How strict at each level]

## Spacing Rules
[Same structure]

## Workflow Rules (ALL LEVELS)
### BEFORE Building UI/UX Work

3. Ask about references
4. Ask about /inspire
5. Get adherence levels (both scales)
6. Study references
7. Brainstorm approaches
8. Show concept
9. Get approval
10. Build

## Violation Tracking
### [Date]: [Rule Name]
- **File:** [path]

## Real-World Example

### Initial Violation (No DESIGN_RULES.md)

```
User feedback:
"Supreme LL 300 used again - must be 400. Also protocol is buried,
should be hero. You didn't study anti-aging page before building."

Agent fixes issues manually.
User has to explain again next time.
```

### After --learn (DESIGN_RULES.md Created)

```bash
/agentfeedback --learn Supreme LL 300 used again - 3rd time. Must be 400.
Protocol buried - should be hero. Didn't study anti-aging page first.

# System extracts:
üìö RULE EXTRACTION COMPLETE

Extracted 3 rules from your feedback:

**Typography Rules:**
1. Supreme LL: ONLY 400 weight (NEVER 300) ‚Üí Levels 5-3
   Validation: grep check for font-weight: 300

**Information Architecture Rules:**
2. Protocol pages: Protocol is hero (not buried) ‚Üí ALL levels
   Validation: Manual review of hierarchy

**Workflow Rules:**
3. BEFORE building: Search for similar pages, study references ‚Üí ALL levels
   Validation: Manual verification of research phase

**Violation Tracking:**
- Supreme LL 300: 3rd occurrence
- Skipped reference study: 2nd occurrence

Stored in DESIGN_RULES.md - will auto-enforce in future work.
```

### Next Design/UX Work (Auto-Enforcement)

```
User: /agentfeedback Fix recomposition protocol page spacing

# System detects design issue
# Reads DESIGN_RULES.md
# Finds similar pages (protocols/anti-aging)
# Asks user: "Use anti-aging as reference?"
# Asks: "Design adherence 1-5?"
# User chooses: 5 (strict compliance)

# Agent builds with design-master
# Knows: Supreme LL 400 only, protocol must be hero
# Follows workflow: studied anti-aging page first

# Before presenting:
# Runs validation:
violations=$(grep -rE 'font-weight: 300' app/ | wc -l)
if [ "$violations" -gt 0 ]; then
  # Agent catches violation BEFORE showing user
  # Fixes automatically
  # Re-validates
fi

# ‚úÖ All checks pass
# User sees correct work on first try
```

- Rules extracted automatically from feedback
- Violations caught BEFORE presenting work
- Learning system prevents repeated mistakes
- User sets creative freedom level (1-5 scales)
- Time saved on quality control

**Target:**
- 80% reduction in repeated corrections
- 90% of typography/spacing violations caught automatically
- 100% workflow compliance for design/UX work
- Adaptive enforcement based on user's creative needs

## Key Innovations

1. **Two adherence scales:** Design guide + Inspiration (independent control)
2. **Frustration detection:** Recognizes "again", "3rd time", "still seeing"
3. **Adherence-aware validation:** Rules flex based on creative constraints
4. **Interactive workflow:** Ask ‚Üí Show ‚Üí Approve before building
5. **Violation tracking:** Learn from patterns, not just single instances

---

**This system turns frustration into automation. Every repeated correction becomes a rule that prevents future violations.**
