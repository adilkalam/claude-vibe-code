# Ultra-Think: Deep Analysis Mode

Analyze this problem/question: {{TASK}}

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Problem Analysis
- Core challenge
- Observable patterns
- Key questions
- Hypothesis formation

### 2. Multi-Dimensional Analysis
Examine from multiple perspectives:
- Technical dimension
- User experience dimension
- System design dimension
- Process dimension
- Alternative viewpoints

### 3. Evidence Analysis
- Supporting evidence
- Contradicting evidence
- Confidence levels
- Areas of uncertainty

### 4. Cross-Domain Thinking
Apply patterns from other domains:
- What analogies apply?
- What can we learn from similar problems?
- How do other fields solve this?

### 5. Solution Options
For each potential solution:
- Approach
- Pros
- Cons
- Implementation complexity
- Success likelihood

### 6. Recommendation
- Primary solution
- Why it's best
- Implementation plan
- Risk mitigation
- Success metrics

### 7. Meta-Analysis
- Confidence levels for each conclusion
- What could invalidate this analysis
- What we don't know
- Next steps for validation

## Output Format

Structure your analysis with clear sections:
- **Problem Analysis**: Define the core issue
- **Multi-Dimensional Analysis**: Explore all angles
- **Evidence**: What supports/contradicts
- **Solutions**: Multiple options with tradeoffs
- **Recommendation**: Clear path forward
- **Confidence**: Where we're certain vs uncertain

Use this framework to provide deep, nuanced analysis that considers multiple perspectives and acknowledges uncertainty.
