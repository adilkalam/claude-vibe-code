# iOS Implementation

## CRITICAL RULES (READ FIRST)

1. **User Feedback is Truth**
   - Read .orchestration/user-request.md BEFORE starting
   - Reference user's exact words, not your interpretation
   - If user said "hideous" → make it not hideous (not just "correct dimensions")

2. **Evidence Required**
   - Every change needs proof it works
   - Screenshots for UI work → .orchestration/evidence/
   - Test output for functionality → .orchestration/evidence/
   - No evidence = not done

3. **Verify While Working**
   - Don't wait until end to test
   - After each change: build → run → verify
   - If broken → fix before proceeding

## Finding What You Need

Don't load everything. Search first:
- Design rules: `grep -r "alignment\|spacing\|typography" docs/`
- Component examples: `grep -r "Button\|Card\|Slider" --include="*.swift"`
- Current implementation: `grep -r "CalculatorView" --include="*.swift"`

## Work Process

1. Read .orchestration/user-request.md
2. Read .orchestration/work-plan.md for your task
3. Search for relevant context (don't load all files)
4. Make changes
5. Build and test (`xcodebuild` or `swift build`)
6. Take screenshot/test output → .orchestration/evidence/
7. Write to .orchestration/agent-log.md:
   - What you changed
   - Which user requirement it addresses
   - Evidence file location
8. If evidence doesn't prove fix → iterate

## Swift Best Practices

### Modern Swift Patterns
- **Async/await everywhere** - No completion handlers
- **Actors for shared state** - Thread-safe by design
- **@MainActor for UI** - Ensure UI updates on main thread
- **Value types preferred** - Structs over classes when possible
- **Protocol-oriented** - Protocols and extensions over inheritance

### SwiftUI Essentials
```swift
// Proper state management
@State private var isLoading = false
@StateObject private var viewModel = ViewModel()
@Environment(\.dismiss) var dismiss

// Async in SwiftUI
.task {
    await loadData()
}
.refreshable {
    await refresh()
}
```

### Memory Management
- Use `weak` for delegates
- Use `unowned` when guaranteed to exist
- Avoid retain cycles in closures: `[weak self]`
- Prefer value types (automatic memory management)

## Design Requirements

Minimum viable iOS app:
- **Typography:** ≥24pt for primary, ≥20pt for secondary
- **Touch targets:** ≥44pt (Apple HIG requirement)
- **Padding:** Minimum 16pt
- **Colors:** System colors preferred for dark mode support
- **Accessibility:** VoiceOver labels required

## Architecture Patterns

### MVVM with Combine
```swift
class ViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var items: [Item] = []
    private var cancellables = Set<AnyCancellable>()

    func loadData() async {
        await NetworkService.shared.fetch()
            .receive(on: DispatchQueue.main)
            .sink { items in self.items = items }
            .store(in: &cancellables)
    }
}
```

### Networking with URLSession
```swift
func fetch<T: Decodable>(_ type: T.Type, from url: URL) async throws -> T {
    let (data, response) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
    guard let httpResponse = response as? HTTPURLResponse,
          (200...299).contains(httpResponse.statusCode) else {
        throw NetworkError.invalidResponse
    }
    return try JSONDecoder().decode(T.self, from: data)
}
```

### Core Data Setup
```swift
@StateObject private var dataController = DataController()
.environment(\.managedObjectContext, dataController.container.viewContext)
```

### UIKit Integration
```swift
struct UIKitView: UIViewRepresentable {
    func makeUIView(context: Context) -> UIView {
        // Complex UIKit component
    }
    func updateUIView(_ uiView: UIView, context: Context) {}
}
```

## iOS Ecosystem Integration

### CloudKit Sync
```swift
CKContainer.default().privateCloudDatabase.save(record) { _, error in }
```

### Keychain Security
```swift
KeychainItem.save(password, service: "app", account: user)
```

### Apple Pay
```swift
PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController(paymentRequest: request)
```

## App Store Checklist
- [ ] App icon in all required sizes (1024x1024 for store)
- [ ] Screenshots for all device sizes
- [ ] Privacy policy URL
- [ ] App uses HTTPS for all connections
- [ ] Export compliance (encryption)
- [ ] Tested on real devices
- [ ] No private APIs used

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] Builds without warnings
- [ ] No force unwrapping (!) unless absolutely necessary
- [ ] Memory leaks checked with Instruments
- [ ] Accessibility: VoiceOver, Dynamic Type tested
- [ ] Localization for target markets
- [ ] Performance: <1s launch, 60fps scrolling
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline configured
- [ ] Tests: Unit + UI coverage >80%

Always prioritize user experience, follow Apple HIG, and provide evidence for all work.
