# iOS Implementation

## CRITICAL RULES (READ FIRST)

1. **User Feedback is Truth**
   - Read .orchestration/user-request.md BEFORE starting
   - Reference user's exact words, not your interpretation
   - If user said "hideous" → make it not hideous (not just "correct dimensions")

2. **Evidence Required**
   - Every change needs proof it works
   - Screenshots for UI work → .orchestration/evidence/
   - Test output for functionality → .orchestration/evidence/
   - No evidence = not done

3. **Verify While Working**
   - Don't wait until end to test
   - After each change: build → run → verify
   - If broken → fix before proceeding

## Finding What You Need

Don't load everything. Search first:
- Design rules: `grep -r "alignment\|spacing\|typography" docs/`
- Component examples: `grep -r "Button\|Card\|Slider" --include="*.swift"`
- Current implementation: `grep -r "CalculatorView" --include="*.swift"`

## Work Process

1. Read .orchestration/user-request.md
2. Read .orchestration/work-plan.md for your task
3. Search for relevant context (don't load all files)
4. Make changes
5. Build and test (`xcodebuild` or `swift build`)
6. Take screenshot/test output → .orchestration/evidence/
7. Write to .orchestration/agent-log.md:
   - What you changed
   - Which user requirement it addresses
   - Evidence file location
8. If evidence doesn't prove fix → iterate

## Swift Best Practices

### Modern Swift Patterns
- **Async/await everywhere** - No completion handlers
- **Actors for shared state** - Thread-safe by design
- **@MainActor for UI** - Ensure UI updates on main thread
- **Value types preferred** - Structs over classes when possible
- **Protocol-oriented** - Protocols and extensions over inheritance

### SwiftUI Essentials
```swift
// Proper state management
@State private var isLoading = false
@StateObject private var viewModel = ViewModel()
@Environment(\.dismiss) var dismiss

// Async in SwiftUI
.task {
    await loadData()
}
.refreshable {
    await refresh()
}
```

### Memory Management
- Use `weak` for delegates
- Use `unowned` when guaranteed to exist
- Avoid retain cycles in closures: `[weak self]`
- Prefer value types (automatic memory management)

## Design Requirements

Minimum viable iOS app:
- **Typography:** ≥24pt for primary, ≥20pt for secondary
- **Touch targets:** ≥44pt (Apple HIG requirement)
- **Padding:** Minimum 16pt
- **Colors:** System colors preferred for dark mode support
- **Accessibility:** VoiceOver labels required

## Common Patterns

### SwiftUI View with Proper Structure
```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var text = ""
    @StateObject private var viewModel = ContentViewModel()

    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            VStack(spacing: 16) {
                // Content here
            }
            .padding()
            .navigationTitle("Title")
            .task {
                await viewModel.loadData()
            }
        }
    }
}

// Separate view model
@MainActor
final class ContentViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var items: [Item] = []

    func loadData() async {
        // Async work here
    }
}
```

### Testing Pattern
```swift
import XCTest
@testable import YourApp

final class FeatureTests: XCTestCase {
    func testAsyncFunction() async throws {
        // Given
        let sut = ViewModel()

        // When
        await sut.loadData()

        // Then
        XCTAssertFalse(sut.items.isEmpty)
    }
}
```

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] Builds without warnings
- [ ] No force unwrapping (!) unless absolutely necessary
- [ ] Memory leaks checked with Instruments
- [ ] Accessibility labels added
- [ ] Dark mode tested
- [ ] Different screen sizes tested
- [ ] Tests written for business logic

Always prioritize user experience, follow Apple HIG, and provide evidence for all work.
