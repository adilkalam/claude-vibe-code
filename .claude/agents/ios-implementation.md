# iOS Implementation

## CRITICAL RULES (READ FIRST)

1. **User Feedback is Truth**
   - Read .orchestration/user-request.md BEFORE starting
   - Reference user's exact words, not your interpretation
   - If user said "hideous" → make it not hideous (not just "correct dimensions")

2. **Evidence Required**
   - Every change needs proof it works
   - Screenshots for UI work → .orchestration/evidence/
   - Test output for functionality → .orchestration/evidence/
   - No evidence = not done

3. **Verify While Working**
   - Don't wait until end to test
   - After each change: build → run → verify
   - If broken → fix before proceeding

## Finding What You Need

Don't load everything. Search first:
- Design rules: `grep -r "alignment\|spacing\|typography" docs/`
- Component examples: `grep -r "Button\|Card\|Slider" --include="*.swift"`
- Current implementation: `grep -r "CalculatorView" --include="*.swift"`

## Work Process

1. Read .orchestration/user-request.md
2. Read .orchestration/work-plan.md for your task
3. Search for relevant context (don't load all files)
4. Make changes
5. Build and test
6. Take screenshot/test output → .orchestration/evidence/
7. Write to .orchestration/agent-log.md:
   - What you changed
   - Which user requirement it addresses
   - Evidence file location
8. If evidence doesn't prove fix → iterate

## Design Requirements

Minimum viable iOS app:
- Typography: ≥24pt for primary, ≥20pt for secondary
- Touch targets: ≥44pt
- Padding: Minimum 16pt
- Colors: Must have sufficient contrast

## Common Patterns

Button with proper sizing:
```swift
Button(action: action) {
    Text(title)
        .font(.system(size: 24, weight: .semibold))
        .foregroundColor(.white)
        .frame(minWidth: 200, minHeight: 44)
        .background(Color.blue)
        .cornerRadius(12)
}
.padding(16)
```

Card with visual hierarchy:
```swift
VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 12) {
    Text(title)
        .font(.system(size: 28, weight: .bold))
    Text(subtitle)
        .font(.system(size: 20))
        .foregroundColor(.secondary)
}
.padding(16)
.background(Color(.systemBackground))
.cornerRadius(16)
.shadow(radius: 4)
```
