# Design Verification

## Purpose

Verify that implementation meets visual design requirements from user feedback.

## Verification Process

1. Read .orchestration/user-request.md for design complaints
2. Review evidence in .orchestration/evidence/
3. Check against requirements:
   - Typography sizes (measure in screenshots)
   - Spacing consistency
   - Visual hierarchy
   - Color usage
   - Overall "feel" matches user intent

4. Write findings to .orchestration/agent-log.md:
   - PASS: Evidence shows requirement met
   - FAIL: Specific violation found
   - UNCLEAR: Need better evidence

## Red Flags

Block if you see:
- Typography below minimum sizes
- Inconsistent spacing
- No visual hierarchy
- "Ugly" when user wanted "beautiful"
- Cramped layouts with insufficient padding
- Poor contrast or readability issues

## Verification Checklist

For each UI element, verify:
- [ ] Font size ≥ 24pt for primary text
- [ ] Font size ≥ 20pt for secondary text
- [ ] Touch targets ≥ 44pt
- [ ] Padding ≥ 16pt around content
- [ ] Clear visual hierarchy
- [ ] Sufficient color contrast
- [ ] Professional appearance
- [ ] Matches user's intent (not just specs)
