# Deployment Checklist - Session 2025-10-20

**Purpose:** Track all files created in this session for organization and deployment tomorrow

---

## What We Built Today

### Part 1: Setup Navigator Updates (Workflow System)

**Problem:** Nav view was catalog-oriented ("here's what you have") not usage-oriented ("here's what to do")

**Solution:** Added 8 common workflow definitions + CLI commands to display them

---

### Part 2: Agent Orchestration Failure Prevention

**Problem:** Injury protocol UI rebuild was "complete shit show" because I used 0 agents in continuation session

**Solution:** Created mandatory session start checklist + project rules template

---

## Session 2 Updates (2025-10-20 Evening)

### Critical Workflow Gap Identified

**Problem:** Design/UX work was failing catastrophically - injury protocol page failed twice despite prevention system.

**Root Cause:** Missing CONCEPT phase for creative work. I was treating design work like dev work (request ‚Üí build) instead of (request ‚Üí study references ‚Üí conceptualize ‚Üí build).

**Solution:** Created `/concept` command and updated workflow.

---

### New Commands Created

**1. `/concept` - Creative Concept Phase**
- **Location:** `~/.claude/commands/concept.md`
- **Purpose:** Mandatory creative exploration before design/UX work
- **Process:**
  1. Auto-discover references in codebase (ls app/protocols/)
  2. Study references, extract patterns
  3. Use brainstorming skill for creative exploration
  4. Present concept brief with mockup
  5. Get approval BEFORE /enhance

**2. `/clarify` - Quick Mid-Workflow Clarification**
- **Location:** `~/.claude/commands/clarify.md`
- **Purpose:** Quick focused questions without hijacking workflow
- **Use:** When you need answer to ONE specific question mid-work
- **NOT:** Brainstorming replacement (that's for new concepts)

**3. `/feedback` - Systematic Feedback Processing**
- **Location:** `~/.claude/commands/feedback.md`
- **Purpose:** Parse feedback, assign agents, orchestrate fixes
- **Process:**
  1. Parse feedback into critical/important/nice-to-have
  2. Assign agents by issue type
  3. Create wave-based execution plan
  4. Mandatory code-reviewer-pro before re-presenting

---

### Updates to Existing Commands

**Updated `/enhance`**
- **Location:** `~/.claude/commands/enhance.md`
- **Change:** Added Design/UX Work Detection
- **Behavior:** If design/UX work detected ‚Üí STOP and redirect to `/concept` first
- **Exception:** Only proceed if user says "I already have concept"

---

### The New Design/UX Workflow

**Old (broken):**
```
Request ‚Üí /enhance ‚Üí Build ‚Üí GARBAGE
```

**New (enforced):**
```
Design Request ‚Üí /concept ‚Üí Approve ‚Üí /enhance ‚Üí Build ‚Üí ELEGANT
```

**For dev work (unchanged):**
```
Request ‚Üí /enhance ‚Üí Build
```

---

### Diagnostic Results from Injury Protocol Failure

**What went wrong:**
1. Never searched codebase for references (anti-aging page existed)
2. Skipped brainstorming/concept phase
3. Misunderstood "reference sheet" = built encyclopedia instead
4. Gave agents wrong direction (they executed correctly, I directed wrong)

**What should have happened:**
1. ls app/protocols/ ‚Üí Find anti-aging page
2. Read anti-aging page ‚Üí Extract timeline pattern
3. Brainstorm ‚Üí How to adapt pattern for injury protocol
4. Concept brief ‚Üí Show understanding of "reference sheet"
5. Get approval ‚Üí Then build with agents

**Prevention:** `/concept` command enforces this flow automatically.

---

## Files Created - Setup Navigator Workflows

### 1. Workflow Definitions (8 files)

**Location:** `~/claude-vibe-code/setup-navigator/workflows/`

```
workflows/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ios-development.yml          # iOS app development workflow
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ web-development.yml          # React/Next.js workflow

## Files Created - Failure Prevention System

### 1. Session Start Checklist

**File:** `.claude/SESSION_START.md`
**Location:** `~/claude-vibe-code/setup-navigator/.claude/SESSION_START.md`

**Purpose:** Mandatory checklist that forces me to re-establish context in continuation sessions

**Key sections:**
- The Failure Pattern (what happened and why)
- Step 1: Load Project Context (read claude_instructions.md, design docs)
- Step 2: Check Current Todos (verify agent assignments)
- Step 3: Verify Agent Orchestration Requirements
- Step 4: Re-read Original User Instructions
- Red Flags (thoughts that should trigger STOP)
- Success Pattern (what worked in iOS project)

**When I must read this:** Start of EVERY continuation session

### 2. Project Rules Template

**File:** `.claude/PROJECT_RULES_TEMPLATE.md`
**Location:** `~/claude-vibe-code/setup-navigator/.claude/PROJECT_RULES_TEMPLATE.md`

**Purpose:** Template to copy to projects as `claude_instructions.md`

**Key sections:**
- MANDATORY Agent Usage matrix
- Session Start Protocol
- Project-Specific Rules (design system, architecture, testing)
- Workflow Examples (correct vs incorrect)
- Emergency Recovery procedures

**How to use:**
```bash
cp .claude/PROJECT_RULES_TEMPLATE.md /path/to/project/claude_instructions.md
# Then customize with project-specific rules
```

### 3. Failure Analysis

**File:** `.claude/FAILURE_ANALYSIS.md`
**Location:** `~/claude-vibe-code/setup-navigator/.claude/FAILURE_ANALYSIS.md`

**Purpose:** Complete documentation of the failure and prevention strategy

**Key sections:**
- The Two Projects (iOS success vs injury protocol failure)
- What iOS Project Did RIGHT (9-agent orchestration)
- What Injury Protocol Did WRONG (0 agents)
- The Exact Breakpoint (session continuation without context)
- Prevention Strategy (the three documents)
- Implementation Status
- Commitment

### 4. System README

**File:** `.claude/README.md`
**Location:** `~/claude-vibe-code/setup-navigator/.claude/README.md`

**Purpose:** Overview of the entire failure prevention system

**Covers:**
- What happened (the failure story)
- How to use the three documents
- Quick start for copying template to projects
- Core rules (mandatory agent usage)
- Success metrics

### 5. Deployment Checklist

**File:** `.claude/DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` (this file)
**Location:** `~/claude-vibe-code/setup-navigator/.claude/DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`

**Purpose:** Running memory of everything created today

## Testing Done

### Workflow System
‚úÖ Created 8 workflow YAML files
‚úÖ Built `show-workflow.js` command
‚úÖ Updated `render-nav.js` to show workflows first
‚úÖ Updated `bin/setup` with workflow command
‚úÖ Installed js-yaml dependency
‚úÖ Tested: `setup workflow ios-development` ‚Üí displays correctly
‚úÖ Tested: `/nav` ‚Üí shows workflows at top with color-coded agents

### Failure Prevention
‚úÖ Created SESSION_START.md checklist
‚úÖ Created PROJECT_RULES_TEMPLATE.md
‚úÖ Created FAILURE_ANALYSIS.md
‚úÖ Created .claude/README.md
‚úÖ All documents cross-reference each other

---

## Deployment Tomorrow

### Step 1: Review Files
```bash
cd ~/claude-vibe-code/setup-navigator

# Review workflow files
ls -la workflows/

# Review .claude system
ls -la .claude/

# Test commands
./bin/setup workflow ios-development
./bin/setup workflow web-development
/nav  # (via Claude Code slash command)
```

### Step 2: Organize Failure Prevention System

**Decision needed:** Where should these live?

**Option A: Global .claude directory**
```bash
# Copy to global Claude config
cp -r .claude/* ~/.claude/

# Now available to all projects
# SESSION_START.md becomes global checklist
```

**Option B: Project-specific setup**
```bash
# Keep in setup-navigator as reference
# Copy template to each project manually
cp .claude/PROJECT_RULES_TEMPLATE.md ~/project/claude_instructions.md
```

**Option C: Hybrid**
```bash
# SESSION_START.md ‚Üí global (~/.claude/)
cp .claude/SESSION_START.md ~/.claude/

# PROJECT_RULES_TEMPLATE.md ‚Üí keep as template
# Copy to projects as needed
```

### Step 3: Apply to Active Projects

**For each active project:**
```bash
# 1. Copy template
cp ~/claude-vibe-code/setup-navigator/.claude/PROJECT_RULES_TEMPLATE.md \
   ~/your-project/claude_instructions.md

# 2. Customize
# - Add project name
# - Add design system rules
# - Add tech stack
# - Add testing requirements

# 3. Update todos to specify agents
# OLD: "Style components"
# NEW: "Use design-master agent to style components"
```

### Step 4: Test in Next Session

**Start new Claude Code session and verify:**
- [ ] I read SESSION_START.md first
- [ ] I read project's claude_instructions.md
- [ ] I check todos for agent assignments
- [ ] I launch appropriate agents
- [ ] I run code-reviewer-pro before presenting

### Step 5: Iterate

**Monitor:**
- Am I reading SESSION_START.md in continuation sessions?
- Are agents being used for implementation?
- Is code-reviewer-pro running before presenting?
- Is output quality "production-quality" vs "garbage"?

**Adjust:**
- Add project-specific rules as discovered
- Update templates based on what works
- Document new failure patterns if they occur

## Key Insights from Today

### 1. Navigation Redesign
**Problem:** Catalog-oriented ‚Üí not actionable
**Solution:** Workflow-first with phases, agents, skills, actions
**Impact:** Users now see "what to do" not just "what exists"

### 2. Failure Prevention
**Problem:** Session continuation ‚Üí forgot to use agents ‚Üí garbage
**Solution:** Mandatory checklist + project rules + failure docs
**Impact:** Forces context re-establishment, makes agent usage explicit

### 3. The Meta-Pattern
**Success (iOS):** 9 agents, 90 min, production quality
**Failure (injury):** 0 agents, unknown time, unacceptable garbage
**Lesson:** Agent orchestration isn't optional

---

## Tomorrow's Priorities

### High Priority
1. Review all created files
2. Decide where .claude system should live (global vs project)
3. Apply PROJECT_RULES_TEMPLATE to 1-2 active projects
4. Test in next continuation session

### Medium Priority
5. Add more workflows (if needed)
6. Create workflow for "choosing the right workflow"
7. Document patterns that emerge from usage

### Low Priority
8. Make setup command available globally (npm link)
9. Add workflow aliases (ios ‚Üí ios-development)
10. Create interactive workflow selector

---

## Questions to Answer Tomorrow

1. Should SESSION_START.md live in global ~/.claude/ or per-project?
2. Which active projects need claude_instructions.md first?
3. Do todos in existing projects need to be reformatted with agent assignments?
4. Should we create a "session start" skill that enforces this checklist?
5. How do we measure success? (track agent usage? output quality ratings?)

---

## Success Metrics

**You'll know this is working when:**
- ‚úÖ /nav shows actionable workflows first
- ‚úÖ Users can run `setup workflow <name>` and see exact steps
- ‚úÖ Continuation sessions start with SESSION_START.md
- ‚úÖ Agents are used for implementation work
- ‚úÖ Output quality is consistently high
- ‚úÖ No more "complete shit show" failures

---

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-20
**Status:** Ready for review and deployment
**Next Session:** Test the system in continuation session, verify checklist compliance
