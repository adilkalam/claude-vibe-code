# Setup Navigator - Session Context

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-20

## Project Overview

Setup Navigator is a discovery and documentation system for Claude Code global setup (~/.claude/), inspired by Agentwise. Instead of orchestrating multi-agent workflows, it helps you understand and optimize your existing 29 agents, 12 skills, and 10 plugins.

## Current Status: ✅ COMPLETE & READY TO USE

### What's Been Built

1. **Natural Language CLI** (`bin/setup`)
   - `setup "ios architecture"` - instant natural language queries
   - `setup list opus` - filter by model
   - `setup analyze` - optimization analysis
   - Aliases: s (scan), q (query), a (analyze), d (docs), l (list)

2. **MCP Server** (`mcp/server.py`)
   - 5 tools: setup_scan, setup_query, setup_list_agents, setup_analyze, setup_docs
   - ✅ Installed in ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   - Ready to use after Claude Desktop restart

3. **Query Engine** (`lib/query-engine.js`)
   - Scored search: "pixel-perfect design" → design-master (score 39)
   - Domain patterns: iOS, Swift, design, frontend, etc.
   - Fuzzy matching for typos

4. **Setup Analyzer** (`cli/analyze.js`)
   - Model distribution: 13.8% Opus, 75.9% Sonnet, 10.3% Haiku ✅ OPTIMAL
   - Cost: $50-150/month estimated
   - Found: 1 duplicate agent-organizer, 22 Leamas agents to consolidate

5. **Documentation Generator** (`cli/generate-docs.js`)
   - Auto-generates SETUP-DOCUMENTATION.md
   - Agent capability matrix, quick reference guide

## Your Setup (Discovered)

- **29 Agents**: ios-dev, swift-architect, swiftui-specialist, design-master, etc.
- **12 Skills**: design-with-precision, UXscii components, superpowers skills
- **10 Plugins**: Enabled and tracked
- **Model Strategy**: 75.9% Sonnet (cost-efficient), 13.8% Opus (high-value tasks)

## Installation Status

✅ MCP server installed
✅ CLI executable (`chmod +x bin/setup`)
✅ Registry built (`output/registry.json`)
⏳ Waiting for: Claude Desktop restart to activate MCP tools

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Terminal
./bin/setup "ios architecture"
./bin/setup list opus
./bin/setup analyze

# Claude Code (after restart)
"Which agent for SwiftUI optimization?"
"Show me all my Opus agents"
"Analyze my setup"
```

## Key Files

- `bin/setup` - Natural language CLI wrapper
- `cli/scan.js` - Scans ~/.claude/ directory (600+ lines)
- `cli/query.js` - Natural language queries
- `cli/analyze.js` - Setup optimization (450+ lines)
- `lib/query-engine.js` - Scoring algorithm (350+ lines)
- `lib/scanner.js` - Agent/skill extraction (600+ lines)
- `mcp/server.py` - MCP server with 5 tools (320+ lines)
- `output/registry.json` - Complete setup inventory
- `install-mcp.sh` - Automatic installer

## Test Results

✅ Scanner: Found all 29 agents, 12 skills, 10 plugins
✅ Query: "pixel-perfect design" → design-master (score 39)
✅ Query: "iOS architecture" → ios-dev (53), swift-architect (51), swiftui-specialist (38)
✅ Analyzer: Full analysis with recommendations
✅ Model filter: `--model opus` → 4 agents
✅ MCP install: Successfully added to claude_desktop_config.json
✅ CLI: `./bin/setup "ios architecture"` working perfectly

## Bugs Fixed During Development

1. **Analyzer crash**: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'opus')"
   - Fixed: Changed `costEstimates` to `costs` in analyzeSetup() (line 51)

2. **Analyzer crash**: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'estimated')"
   - Fixed: Restructured analyzeCosts() return value, added defensive checks

## Next Steps (When You Return)

The system is **complete and ready to use**. Potential enhancements:

1. **Test from Claude Code**: After restarting Claude Desktop, test MCP tools
2. **npm link**: Make `setup` command available globally
3. **Add more patterns**: Extend query engine with more domain keywords
4. **Category auto-detection**: Improve agent categorization logic
5. **Cost tracking**: Add actual usage tracking vs. estimates

## User Feedback

> "wow, fucking EPIC" - User's reaction to the system

## Architecture Inspiration

Based on [Agentwise](https://github.com/VibeCodingWithPhil/agentwise):
- Multi-agent orchestration → Discovery tool
- Token optimization → Cost analysis
- Self-improving agents → Setup optimization
- 25 MCP servers → 5 MCP tools for setup discovery

## Important Notes

- MCP server path: `/Users/adilkalam/claude-vibe-code/setup-navigator/mcp/server.py`
- Config location: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Registry auto-rebuilds on scan
- All 29 agents inventoried with metadata extraction from YAML frontmatter
- Natural language queries work without "query" keyword
