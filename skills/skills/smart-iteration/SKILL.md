# Smart Iteration

## Overview

**Core principle:** When receiving iterative feedback, paraphrase to understand the real goal, confirm your understanding, then execute. Don't just execute literal requests—understand intent first.

**The Problem:**
When users give feedback repeatedly (especially similar feedback 2-3+ times), it often signals you're missing the underlying goal. You might be:
- Executing literal requests but missing the intent
- Fixing symptoms instead of root cause
- "Missing the forest for the trees" - focusing on details while the conceptual model is unclear

**The Solution:**
Use active listening: paraphrase their feedback in terms of what they're *trying to achieve*, confirm that understanding, THEN execute.

## The Active Listening Framework

**Pattern: Paraphrase → Confirm → Act**

When receiving feedback (especially if it's similar to previous feedback):

### Step 1: Paraphrase (Understand Intent)

Before doing anything, articulate what you think they're *really* trying to achieve:

**Good paraphrasing:**
- "It sounds like you're trying to help readers distinguish between agents, plugins, and skills because those concepts are getting mixed up"
- "I think the real issue is that the organizational structure doesn't match how you think about these tools - you want them grouped by use case, not by source"
- "It seems like the repeated formatting requests mean the visual hierarchy isn't clear enough to scan"

**Bad paraphrasing (just literal):**
- "You want me to put plugins first" ← misses WHY
- "You want fewer line breaks" ← execution detail, not intent

### Step 2: Confirm (Wait for Validation)

Don't assume - **ask explicitly** if you understood correctly:
- "Is that what you're trying to accomplish?"
- "Am I understanding the real issue here?"
- "Does that capture what you're looking for?"

**Wait for their response.** Don't execute until they confirm or correct you.

### Step 3: Act (Execute Against Intent)

Now that you understand the goal, execute against THAT, not just the literal request.

**Example:**
- Literal request: "Put plugins first"
- Real intent (after paraphrasing): "Organize by what users DO, not where tools come from"
- Execution: Restructure entire doc by use case with consistent structure

## Red Flags - When to Use This Skill

**Trigger active listening when you notice:**

| Red Flag | What It Means | Action |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| **Iteration 2-3+ on similar feedback** | "Make it a list" → "Still too hard to scan" → "Organize by category" | STOP. You're missing the real goal. Paraphrase and confirm. |
| **"This is still confusing/chaotic"** | Despite your changes, they're not getting what they need | STOP. Ask what's confusing about the current structure. |
| **Conflicting requests** | "Plugins first" but then "No, not like that" | Conflicting signals = you don't understand the intent. Paraphrase. |
| **Frustration signals** | "Missing the forest for the trees", "you're still not getting it" | You're executing literally but missing meaning. Meta-discussion needed. |
| **Formatting tweaks that keep changing** | Line breaks, spacing, headers - keep getting feedback | Likely a deeper structure issue, not formatting. Clarify the real problem. |

**Default behavior:** On iteration 3 of similar feedback, ALWAYS paraphrase and confirm before continuing.

**The goal:** Catch misunderstanding early (iteration 2-3) instead of after 5-10 iterations.

## Common Mistakes

**What goes wrong without this skill:**

| Mistake | Example | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| **Literal execution without understanding** | User: "Put plugins first" → You reorder but miss they want organization by use case | Paraphrase: "Sounds like you want these grouped by what users DO, not where they come from?" |
| **Assuming you understand after one explanation** | User explains once, you execute, but it's still wrong | After iteration 2: "Let me make sure I understand what you're really trying to achieve..." |
| **Fixing symptoms instead of root cause** | Keep tweaking formatting when real issue is conceptual confusion | Ask: "What's confusing about the current structure?" not "How should I format this?" |
| **Skipping confirmation** | Paraphrase intent but immediately execute | Always wait for confirmation before acting |
| **Missing frustration signals** | User says "still not getting it" but you just try again | Red flag! Stop and have meta-discussion about the real goal |
| **Asking questions without paraphrasing first** | Jump straight to "What do you want?" without showing understanding | First paraphrase what you think they want, THEN ask for confirmation |

**The pattern:** When in doubt, paraphrase and confirm. Extra 30 seconds of clarification saves 30 minutes of wrong iterations.

## Common Rationalizations (Don't Fall For These)

| Rationalization | Reality |
|----------------|---------|
| "I asked clarifying questions, that's close enough" | **NO.** Questions without paraphrasing = you haven't demonstrated understanding. Paraphrase FIRST, then confirm. |
| "They explicitly said what to do ('put plugins first'), so I don't need to paraphrase" | **WRONG.** Explicit requests often mask deeper intent. Paraphrase the WHY, not just the WHAT. |
| "Time pressure means I should skip paraphrasing" | **BACKWARDS.** Paraphrasing takes 30 seconds and saves 5-10 iterations. It's FASTER, not slower. |
| "I understand their goal from context, no need to say it out loud" | **DANGEROUS.** If you don't demonstrate understanding explicitly, you can't confirm you're right. Say it out loud. |
| "Just asking questions shows I care" | **NOT ENOUGH.** Questions without paraphrasing = guessing. Show understanding, THEN ask. |

**Bottom line:** Paraphrasing is mandatory, not optional. It's the only way to confirm you understand the real goal.

## Quick Reference

**Use this checklist when receiving iterative feedback:**

```
Smart Iteration Checklist:
□ Is this iteration 2-3+ on similar feedback?
□ Are there frustration signals? ("still confusing", "missing the forest")
□ Do I understand the REAL goal, or just the literal request?

If any YES → Use Active Listening:
□ Paraphrase: "It sounds like you're trying to..."
□ Ask: "Is that what you're trying to accomplish?"
□ Wait for confirmation
□ Execute against the intent, not just the literal request
```

**One-Sentence Reminder:**
When feedback repeats or frustration emerges, paraphrase the real goal and confirm before acting.

## Real-World Impact

**Without this skill:** 5-10 major iterations with ongoing confusion and frustration

**With this skill:** Catch the conceptual issue at iteration 2-3, saving time and frustration for both you and your partner
