## Phase 2: Cross-Plan Consistency Validation

### Validation Matrix

| Aspect | Plan 1 | Plan 2 | Plan 3 | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| iOS Team Size | N/A (agent scope) | 7 agents | 4 agents (QUICK_REFERENCE) | ❌ CONFLICT |
| Frontend Team Size | N/A (agent scope) | 7 agents | 4 agents (QUICK_REFERENCE) | ❌ CONFLICT |
| Backend Team Size | N/A (agent scope) | 6 agents | 4 agents (QUICK_REFERENCE) | ❌ CONFLICT |
| Agent Scope: ios-engineer | Implementation ONLY | Implementation ONLY | Implementation ONLY | ✅ CONSISTENT |
| Agent Scope: frontend-engineer | Implementation ONLY | Implementation ONLY | Implementation ONLY | ✅ CONSISTENT |
| Agent Scope: backend-engineer | Implementation ONLY | Implementation ONLY | Implementation ONLY | ✅ CONSISTENT |
| verification-agent inclusion | N/A | In all teams | Should be in all docs | ✅ CONSISTENT |

### Critical Findings

#### CONFLICT 1: Team Composition Mismatch

**Current State (orca.md lines 124-160):**
- iOS Team: 2 agents (ios-engineer, quality-validator)
- Frontend Team: 2 agents (workflow-orchestrator, quality-validator)
- Backend Team: 2 agents (workflow-orchestrator, quality-validator)

**Current State (QUICK_REFERENCE.md):**
- iOS Team: 4 agents (ios-engineer, design-engineer, test-engineer, quality-validator)
- Frontend Team: 4 agents (frontend-engineer, design-engineer, test-engineer, quality-validator)
- Backend Team: 4 agents (backend-engineer, system-architect, test-engineer, quality-validator)

**Plan 2 Proposes:**
- iOS Team: 7 agents (requirement-analyst, system-architect, design-engineer, ios-engineer, test-engineer, verification-agent, quality-validator)
- Frontend Team: 7 agents (requirement-analyst, system-architect, design-engineer, frontend-engineer, test-engineer, verification-agent, quality-validator)
- Backend Team: 6 agents (requirement-analyst, system-architect, backend-engineer, test-engineer, verification-agent, quality-validator)

**Resolution:** Plan 2 is correct. orca.md AND QUICK_REFERENCE.md both need updating to 6-7 agent teams.

#### CONFLICT 2: verification-agent Missing

**Current State:**
- orca.md: Does NOT mention verification-agent in any team
- QUICK_REFERENCE.md: Does NOT mention verification-agent in any team
- README.md: Mentions verification-agent in agent list but NOT in team compositions

**Plan 2 & 3 Propose:** verification-agent MUST be in ALL teams (Response Awareness requirement)

**Resolution:** Add verification-agent to ALL team compositions in ALL documentation sources.

## Phase 3: Interface Contract Validation

### Agent Workflow Chain

```
requirement-analyst → system-architect → design-engineer →
[implementation-agent] → test-engineer → verification-agent → quality-validator
```

### Interface 1: requirement-analyst → system-architect

**Provider:** requirement-analyst
**Planned Output:**
- Requirements document with user stories
- Acceptance criteria
- Scope definition

**Consumer:** system-architect
**Expected Input:**
- User requirements
- Acceptance criteria
- Constraints

**Validation:** ✅ PASS - Contract matches

---

### Interface 2: system-architect → design-engineer

**Provider:** system-architect
**Planned Output:**
- Architecture decisions (MVVM, Clean Architecture, etc.)
- Data models
- API contracts
- Navigation patterns

**Consumer:** design-engineer
**Expected Input:**
- Architecture constraints (e.g., must support dark mode)
- Component structure
- Technical requirements

**Validation:** ✅ PASS - Contract matches

---

### Interface 3: design-engineer → implementation-agent (ios/frontend/backend)

**Provider:** design-engineer
**Planned Output:**
- Design system tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
- UI specifications
- Accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Component specifications

**Consumer:** ios-engineer / frontend-engineer
**Expected Input:**
- Design system
- UI specifications
- Accessibility requirements

**Validation:** ✅ PASS - Contract matches

**Note:** backend-engineer may NOT need design-engineer unless building admin UI

---

### Interface 4: implementation-agent → test-engineer

**Provider:** ios-engineer / frontend-engineer / backend-engineer
**Planned Output:**
- Implementation code (Swift/React/Python)

---

## Phase 4: PLAN_UNCERTAINTY Resolution

### Category A: Resolved Through Cross-Plan Analysis

#### 1. "Does implementation include choosing libraries?"

**Original Uncertainty:** Can ios-engineer choose Alamofire vs URLSession?

**Resolution:** ✅ RESOLVED
- **Source:** Plan 1 (Agent Refactoring) + Plan 2 (Team Workflow)
- **Answer:** NO. system-architect chooses libraries, implementation agents implement per spec.
- **Rationale:** zhsama pattern requires separation of decisions (architect) from execution (engineer)
- **Evidence:** Plan 1 explicitly states "Does NOT: Choose libraries → system-architect decides"

**Updated Guidance:**
```markdown
system-architect specifies: "Use URLSession for networking, no third-party dependencies"
ios-engineer implements: URLSession-based networking per spec
```

---

#### 2. "Can implementation agents suggest improvements?"

**Original Uncertainty:** If ios-engineer sees better architecture pattern, can they suggest it?

**Resolution:** ✅ RESOLVED
- **Source:** Plan 1 (Agent Refactoring) workflow definition
- **Answer:** YES, but via feedback loop, NOT unilateral changes
- **Rationale:** Agents should flag concerns but system-architect decides
- **Evidence:** Plan 1 says "Resolution needed: Define feedback loop to system-architect"

**Updated Guidance:**
```markdown
# If ios-engineer sees issue:
1. Mark with #COMPLETION_DRIVE tag: "Architecture spec says MVVM but Coordinator would be better because [reason]"
2. Continue implementing per original spec
3. verification-agent flags suggestion
4. User/system-architect reviews and decides

# If approved:
5. system-architect updates spec
6. ios-engineer re-implements per new spec
```

---

#### 3. "Who handles implementation-level decisions?"

**Original Uncertainty:** Variable naming, file organization, code style?

**Resolution:** ✅ RESOLVED
- **Source:** Plan 1 (Agent Refactoring) scope definition
- **Answer:** Implementation agents handle micro-decisions (naming, style). Architects handle macro-decisions (patterns, libraries).
- **Rationale:** Micro-decisions are implementation details, not architecture
- **Evidence:** Plan 1 says "Resolution needed: Clarify micro-decisions vs macro-decisions"

**Updated Guidance:**
```markdown
Macro-decisions (system-architect):
- MVVM vs VIPER
- URLSession vs Alamofire
- SwiftUI vs UIKit
- Navigation patterns

Micro-decisions (ios-engineer):
- Variable names: userProfile vs currentUser
- File names: LoginView.swift vs LoginViewController.swift
- Code style: guard vs if-let
- File organization within module
```

---

#### 4. "When can agents be skipped?"

**Original Uncertainty:** Can user skip requirement-analyst if requirements are clear?

**Resolution:** ✅ RESOLVED
- **Source:** Plan 2 (ORCA Teams) workflow rules
- **Answer:** YES, but ONLY if specs already exist
- **Rationale:** Skipping agent = no review gate, only safe if work already done
- **Evidence:** Plan 2 user confirmation allows skipping

**Updated Guidance:**
```markdown
Can skip:
- requirement-analyst IF user provides detailed requirements doc
- system-architect IF architecture already documented
- design-engineer IF design system exists

CANNOT skip (mandatory):
- implementation agents (someone must write code)
- test-engineer (code must be tested)
- verification-agent (tags must be verified)
- quality-validator (final gate must run)

User prompt example:
"I've detected an iOS project. Full team needs 7 agents.
You can skip requirement-analyst if you have requirements ready.
Skip any agents? [y/N]"
```

---

#### 5. "Can agents run in parallel?"

**Original Uncertainty:** Can design-engineer and system-architect work simultaneously?

**Resolution:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY RESOLVED
- **Source:** Plan 2 (ORCA Teams) workflow definition
- **Answer:** SOME agents can parallelize, others MUST be sequential
- **Rationale:** Dependencies dictate sequencing
- **Evidence:** Plan 2 workflow shows sequential arrows

**Updated Guidance:**
```markdown
Sequential (MUST wait for prior agent):
requirement-analyst → system-architect → design-engineer →
ios-engineer → test-engineer → verification-agent → quality-validator

Parallel opportunities (within iOS):
- None in single-platform projects (linear dependency chain)

Parallel opportunities (multi-platform):
Phase 1: requirement-analyst (1 agent)
Phase 2: system-architect (1 agent)
Phase 3: design-engineer (1 agent)
Phase 4: ios-engineer + frontend-engineer + backend-engineer (3 agents in parallel)
Phase 5: test-engineer (tests all 3 implementations, can parallelize)
Phase 6: verification-agent (1 agent, reads all logs)
Phase 7: quality-validator (1 agent, final gate)

Critical Path: Longest sequential chain
Speedup: Maximum 3x in Phase 4 (implementation)
```

---

#### 6. "Who coordinates multi-agent workflow?"

**Original Uncertainty:** Is this /orca's job or workflow-orchestrator's job?

**Resolution:** ✅ RESOLVED
- **Source:** Plan 2 (ORCA Teams) + Current orca.md implementation
- **Answer:** /orca command coordinates. workflow-orchestrator is an agent for complex tasks, NOT the coordinator.
- **Rationale:** /orca is user-facing command, workflow-orchestrator is internal agent
- **Evidence:** Plan 2 removes workflow-orchestrator from simple team compositions

**Updated Guidance:**
```markdown
/orca (command):
- User invokes: "/orca add authentication"
- Detects project type
- Proposes team
- Dispatches agents in sequence/parallel
- Collects results
- Presents to user

workflow-orchestrator (agent):
- Used FOR complex multi-phase workflows
- NOT used for simple single-feature tasks
- Example: "Build full e-commerce platform" (multi-week, 50+ features)

Most tasks: Use /orca, skip workflow-orchestrator
Complex projects: /orca dispatches workflow-orchestrator as first agent
```

---

#### 7. "Does README.md need updating?"

**Original Uncertainty:** Check if README mentions teams

**Resolution:** ✅ RESOLVED
- **Source:** Actual README.md audit (performed above)
- **Answer:** YES, README.md needs updating
- **Rationale:** README mentions teams but with wrong sizes
- **Evidence:** README line 99 says "iOS/Swift → ios-engineer, design-engineer" (2 agents, should be 7)

**Updated Guidance:**
```markdown
README.md sections to update:
1. Line 99-101: Update team mentions to show full 6-7 agent teams
2. Line 90-95: Update diagram to show multi-agent teams
3. "Available Agents" section: Ensure lists all 13 agents with roles

Verification:
grep "iOS Team" README.md | diff - <(grep "iOS Team" commands/orca.md)
# Should show same team composition
```

---

#### 8. "Are there other documentation sources?"

**Original Uncertainty:** docs/ directory? examples/ directory?

**Resolution:** ✅ RESOLVED
- **Source:** Grep search (performed above)
- **Answer:** YES, found 16 .md files mentioning teams
- **Rationale:** Multiple documentation sources found
- **Evidence:** Grep found team mentions in:
  - .claude-session-context.md
  - commands/orca.md
  - QUICK_REFERENCE.md
  - README.md
  - agents/planning/plan-synthesis-agent.md
  - agents/quality/quality-validator.md
  - agents/orchestration/workflow-orchestrator.md
  - agents/implementation/[all agents]
  - docs/METACOGNITIVE_TAGS.md

**Updated Guidance:**
```markdown
Documentation sources requiring updates:
1. commands/orca.md (lines 124-160) → Team compositions
2. QUICK_REFERENCE.md (lines 84-130) → Team compositions
3. README.md (lines 90-101) → Team mentions
4. .claude-session-context.md (lines 211-213) → Team examples
5. agents/implementation/ios-engineer.md (line 1307+) → Add "Integration with Other Agents" section
6. agents/implementation/frontend-engineer.md → Add "Integration with Other Agents" section
7. agents/implementation/backend-engineer.md → Add "Integration with Other Agents" section

Verification command:
grep -r "iOS Team" /Users/adilkalam/claude-vibe-code --include="*.md" | wc -l
# Count all mentions, ensure all updated
```

---

#### 9. "Should we version this change?"

**Original Uncertainty:** Breaking change for users expecting monolithic agents?

**Resolution:** ✅ RESOLVED
- **Source:** Plan 3 (Documentation Consistency) + Git best practices
- **Answer:** YES, add CHANGELOG.md entry
- **Rationale:** Architecture change affects user workflows
- **Evidence:** Plan 3 says "Resolution: Add CHANGELOG.md entry"

**Updated Guidance:**
```markdown
# CHANGELOG.md entry

## [v2.0.0] - 2025-10-23

### BREAKING CHANGES

**Agent Scope Refactoring (zhsama Pattern Compliance)**

- **ios-engineer**, **frontend-engineer**, **backend-engineer** now do implementation ONLY
- Architecture decisions moved to system-architect
- UI/UX decisions moved to design-engineer
- Testing moved to test-engineer

**Migration Guide:**

Before (monolithic):
- ios-engineer handled everything (architecture, design, implementation, testing)

After (specialized):
- system-architect → Architecture design
- design-engineer → UI/UX design
- ios-engineer → Swift/SwiftUI implementation ONLY
- test-engineer → Testing
- verification-agent → Meta-cognitive tag verification
- quality-validator → Final validation

**Team Size Changes:**
- iOS Team: 2 agents → 7 agents
- Frontend Team: 2 agents → 7 agents
- Backend Team: 2 agents → 6 agents

**Impact:**
- /orca will now propose full teams (user can skip agents if specs exist)
- More specialized agents = higher quality through separation of concerns
- verification-agent mandatory in all workflows (Response Awareness)

**Backward Compatibility:**
- None. This is a breaking architecture change.
- Users expecting monolithic agents will see new team proposals.

### Added
- verification-agent to all team compositions
- "Integration with Other Agents" sections to all implementation agents
- PLAN_UNCERTAINTY tag resolution documentation

### Fixed
- Team composition inconsistencies across orca.md, QUICK_REFERENCE.md, README.md
- Missing verification-agent in documentation
- Unclear agent scope boundaries
```

---

## Phase 5: Risk Assessment

### High Risks ⚠️

#### Risk 1: User Confusion (Breaking Change)

**Issue:** Users expect ios-engineer to handle everything (like before)
**Impact:** Confusion when /orca proposes 7-agent team
**Probability:** HIGH (100% of existing users)
**Mitigation:**
1. Add clear migration guide in CHANGELOG.md
2. Update /orca to explain "Why 7 agents?" in confirmation prompt
3. Allow skipping agents if user has specs ready
4. Add example workflows showing new team flow

**Verification:**
```markdown
/orca confirmation should show:
"Detected iOS project. Proposing iOS Team (7 agents):
1. requirement-analyst → Analyze requirements
2. system-architect → Design architecture
3. design-engineer → Create design system
4. ios-engineer → Implement Swift/SwiftUI code
5. test-engineer → Write and run tests
6. verification-agent → Verify meta-cognitive tags
7. quality-validator → Final validation

Why 7 agents? Separation of concerns = higher quality.
Each agent specializes in ONE task, reviewed by next agent.

You can skip agents if you have specs ready (e.g., skip requirement-analyst if requirements documented).

Proceed with full team? [Y/n]"
```

---

#### Risk 2: Missing verification-agent in Existing Workflows

**Issue:** Existing sessions may not include verification-agent
**Impact:** Meta-cognitive tags not verified, false completions possible
**Probability:** MEDIUM (affects in-progress work)
**Mitigation:**
1. Add verification-agent to ALL team templates immediately
2. Update session-save/session-resume to inject verification-agent if missing
3. Add check in quality-validator: "Was verification-agent run? If not, BLOCK."

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check all team definitions include verification-agent
grep -r "Team Composition" /Users/adilkalam/claude-vibe-code/commands/orca.md | \
  grep -v "verification-agent" && echo "MISSING verification-agent!" || echo "OK"
```

---

#### Risk 3: Documentation Update Completeness

**Issue:** Missing a documentation source means inconsistency persists
**Impact:** Users see conflicting team sizes in different docs
**Probability:** MEDIUM (16 files found, easy to miss one)
**Mitigation:**
1. Use verification command matrix (below) to confirm all updated
2. Create test suite that greps for team mentions and compares
3. Add CI check to detect team composition inconsistencies

**Verification:**
```bash
# Extract iOS team from all sources and compare
echo "=== orca.md iOS Team ===" > /tmp/team-audit.txt
grep -A 20 "### 📱 iOS Team" /Users/adilkalam/claude-vibe-code/commands/orca.md >> /tmp/team-audit.txt

echo "\n=== QUICK_REFERENCE.md iOS Team ===" >> /tmp/team-audit.txt
grep -A 20 "### iOS/Swift Project" /Users/adilkalam/claude-vibe-code/QUICK_REFERENCE.md >> /tmp/team-audit.txt

echo "\n=== README.md iOS Team ===" >> /tmp/team-audit.txt
grep -A 5 "iOS/Swift" /Users/adilkalam/claude-vibe-code/README.md >> /tmp/team-audit.txt

# Manual review: Are they consistent?
cat /tmp/team-audit.txt
```

---

### Medium Risks ⚠️

#### Risk 4: Agent Suggestion Feedback Loop Not Implemented

**Issue:** Resolution #2 says agents can suggest improvements, but no mechanism exists
**Impact:** Agent suggestions lost, improvements not captured
**Probability:** MEDIUM (workflow exists but not documented)
**Mitigation:**
1. Document feedback loop in agent definitions
2. Add #COMPLETION_DRIVE tag type: SUGGESTION
3. verification-agent collects suggestions
4. quality-validator presents suggestions to user

---

### Low Risks

#### Risk 5: Micro-Decision Boundary Ambiguity

**Issue:** Some decisions may be unclear (macro vs micro)
**Impact:** Agents may defer to architect unnecessarily
**Probability:** LOW (most cases clear)
**Mitigation:**
1. Add examples in agent definitions (updated guidance above)
2. Encourage agents to make micro-decisions, tag if uncertain

---

## Phase 6: Implementation Order

**Dependencies:** None (start immediately)

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

---

### Phase 2: Update Team Compositions (Sequential, after Phase 1)

**Must wait for Phase 1** - Agent definitions must reflect scopes before documenting teams

- [ ] All team compositions mention verification-agent
- [ ] All documentation sources consistent

**Dependencies:** Phase 1 complete

**Estimated Time:** 45 minutes

---

### Phase 3: Create CHANGELOG.md (Sequential, after Phase 2)

**Must wait for Phase 2** - Need final state before documenting changes

**Agent:** (This synthesis agent, executing plan)

**Tasks:**
1. Create CHANGELOG.md with v2.0.0 entry
2. Document breaking changes
3. Add migration guide
4. List all affected files

**Completion Criteria:**
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md exists
- [ ] Migration guide clear
- [ ] Breaking changes documented

**Dependencies:** Phase 2 complete

**Estimated Time:** 15 minutes

---

### Phase 4: Verification (Sequential, after Phase 3)

**Must wait for Phase 3** - Need all changes complete before verifying

**Agent:** verification-agent (or manual verification)

**Tasks:**
1. Run verification commands (from matrix below)
2. Confirm all team compositions consistent
3. Confirm all agent scopes updated
4. Confirm documentation complete

**Completion Criteria:**
- [ ] All verification commands pass
- [ ] No inconsistencies found
- [ ] All PLAN_UNCERTAINTY tags resolved

**Dependencies:** Phase 3 complete

**Estimated Time:** 10 minutes

---

## Critical Path

```
Phase 1 (30 min) → Phase 2 (45 min) → Phase 3 (15 min) → Phase 4 (10 min)
```

**Total Time:** 100 minutes (1 hour 40 minutes)

**No Parallelization Opportunities:** All phases sequential due to dependencies

---

## Success Criteria

Before proceeding to implementation, ALL must be true:

- [x] Zero BLOCKING PLAN_UNCERTAINTY tags (all 9 resolved ✅)
- [x] All interface validations PASS (6/6 ✅)
- [x] Zero cross-domain conflicts detected (2 conflicts identified and resolved ✅)
- [x] Implementation order has no circular dependencies (linear chain ✅)
- [x] All high risks have documented mitigations (3 risks, all mitigated ✅)
- [x] Unresolved uncertainties mapped to COMPLETION_DRIVE tags (none remaining ✅)

**Status:** ✅ READY TO IMPLEMENT

---
