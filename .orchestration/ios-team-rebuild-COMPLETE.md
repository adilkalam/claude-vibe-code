## Swift 6.2 Patterns Implemented

### 1. Approachable Concurrency
- Default MainActor isolation for UI code
- Minimal explicit @MainActor annotations
- @concurrent attribute for explicit parallel execution

### 2. @Observable State Management
- Replaces ObservableObject with @Published
- Fine-grained property-level observation
- No @StateObject needed (just @State)

### 3. Swift Testing Framework
- @Test attribute replaces test... methods
- #expect() replaces XCTAssert family
- #require() for required preconditions
- Parameterized tests with @Test(arguments:)

### 4. State-First Architecture
- "Forget MVVM" philosophy
- Views are pure functions of state
- Unidirectional data flow
- Minimal ViewModels

### 5. Enhanced Sendable
- @retroactive conformance for third-party types
- @unchecked Sendable for manual synchronization
- Global-actor isolated conformances (SE-0470)

### 6. Isolated Deinitializers
- isolated deinit for safe cleanup
- Access MainActor state during deinitialization

---

## iOS Simulator Integration

### Specialists with Simulator Support (9/19):

1. swiftui-developer - UI testing, visual diff
2. uikit-specialist - UIKit testing
3. ios-accessibility-tester - Accessibility audits
4. swift-testing-specialist - Test execution
5. xctest-pro - XCTest execution
6. ui-testing-expert - XCUITest automation
7. ios-debugger - App state capture, log monitoring
8. ios-performance-engineer - Instruments profiling
9. ios-accessibility-tester - Accessibility tree analysis

### Token Efficiency:

| Operation | Without Skill | With Skill | Reduction |
|-----------|--------------|------------|-----------|
| Screen analysis | ~200 lines | ~5 lines | 97.5% |
| Test results | ~150 lines | ~8 lines | 94.7% |
| Build logs | ~500 lines | ~12 lines | 97.6% |
| Overall | High token usage | Minimal output | 96-99% |

### Installation (Optional):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<repo>/ios-simulator-skill.git
cp -r ios-simulator-skill ~/.claude/skills/ios-simulator/
chmod +x ~/.claude/skills/ios-simulator/scripts/*.py
~/.claude/skills/ios-simulator/scripts/sim_health_check.sh
```

---

## Response Awareness Preservation

All 19 specialists include:

### Meta-Cognitive Tagging Protocol

**PLAN_UNCERTAINTY** - During planning when requirements unclear:
```
#PLAN_UNCERTAINTY[API_CONTRACT] - API endpoint structure not defined
#PLAN_UNCERTAINTY[NAVIGATION] - Navigation pattern not specified
#PLAN_UNCERTAINTY[PERF_TARGETS] - Performance targets unclear
```

**COMPLETION_DRIVE** - During implementation when making assumptions:
```
#COMPLETION_DRIVE[STATE_MANAGEMENT] - Assumed @Observable for state
#COMPLETION_DRIVE[ARCHITECTURE] - Chose state-first over TCA
#COMPLETION_DRIVE[CONCURRENCY_CHOICE] - Used default MainActor isolation
```

### Verification Flow

```
Implementation agents (tag assumptions)
    ↓ Create .orchestration/implementation-log.md
verification-agent (search mode - can't rationalize)
    ↓ Runs actual grep/ls/xcodebuild commands
    ↓ Creates verification-report.md
quality-validator (reads verification results)
    ↓ Checks all requirements met
    ↓ Blocks if <100% complete
User receives verified delivery
```
