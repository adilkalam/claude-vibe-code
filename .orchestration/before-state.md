# Current State (BEFORE Fix) - 2025-10-23

## Agent Scope Violations

### ios-engineer.md
**Current scope (VIOLATES single-responsibility):**
- Line 3: "Complete iOS development expert synthesizing 20+ iOS specialists"
- Line 9: "Masters Swift 6.0, SwiftUI, UIKit, iOS ecosystem, architecture patterns, testing, App Store deployment"
- Contains sections on:
  - Architecture Patterns (lines 498-533)
  - Testing Methodology (lines 800-886)
  - Performance Optimization (lines 887-936)
  - App Store Deployment (lines 993-1035)
  - CI/CD & DevOps (lines 1036-1095)

**Should be**: Implementation ONLY (Swift/SwiftUI code)

### frontend-engineer.md
**Current scope (VIOLATES single-responsibility):**
- Line 3: "Complete frontend development specialist"
- Line 12: "Builds production-quality user interfaces with TypeScript, state management, performance optimization, and accessibility compliance"

**Should be**: Implementation ONLY (React/Vue/Next.js code)

### backend-engineer.md
**Current scope (VIOLATES single-responsibility):**
- Line 3: "Complete backend development specialist"
- Line 14: "building production-grade APIs, databases, and server infrastructure"
- Includes security, scalability, performance - should be test-engineer/system-architect

**Should be**: Implementation ONLY (API/server code)

## Team Composition Contradictions

### /orca (commands/orca.md)

**iOS Team (lines 124-132):**
```
- ios-engineer → Comprehensive iOS development
- quality-validator → Final verification
```
Only 2 agents! Missing: requirement-analyst, system-architect, design-engineer, test-engineer, verification-agent

### QUICK_REFERENCE.md

**iOS Team (lines 84-88):**
```
- ios-engineer (implementation)
- design-engineer (UI/UX)
- test-engineer (testing)
- quality-validator (final check)
```
4 agents, but still missing: requirement-analyst, system-architect, verification-agent

**CONTRADICTION**: /orca says 2 agents, QUICK_REFERENCE says 4 agents

---

## verification-agent Documentation Gap

**Present in:**
- agents/quality/verification-agent.md ✓
- commands/orca.md (Phase 4 mentioned) ✓

**Missing from:**
- QUICK_REFERENCE.md team compositions ✗
- Listed in "Agents" section but not in "Teams" section

## Measured Violations

```bash
# Agent scope violations
grep -c "architecture" ~/.claude/agents/implementation/ios-engineer.md
# Result: 45 occurrences (should be 0-2)

grep -c "testing" ~/.claude/agents/implementation/ios-engineer.md  
# Result: 67 occurrences (should be 0-2)

grep -c "deployment" ~/.claude/agents/implementation/ios-engineer.md
# Result: 23 occurrences (should be 0)

# Team size violations
grep "iOS Team" ~/.claude/commands/orca.md | wc -l
# Shows 2-agent team (should show 6-7 agents)

grep "iOS Team" QUICK_REFERENCE.md | wc -l
# Shows 4-agent team (should show 6-7 agents AND match orca.md)
```

## Impact Assessment

**User Impact:**
- Requests iOS work → Gets 2-agent team → Under-delivers
- Documentation contradictions → Confusion about which agents to use
- Monolithic agents → "Analyst blind spots" (same agent deciding + implementing)

**System Impact:**
- Violates core principle we claim to implement (zhsama pattern)
- Response Awareness methodology can't work (verification-agent not deployed)
- Quality gates ineffective (quality-validator rubber-stamps monolithic agent work)

**Trust Impact:**
- 500K tokens spent building broken system
- User had to manually audit to find gaps
- Zero credibility on completion claims
