## How /orca Chooses Specialists

### Team Composition Logic

**Base Team (Always - 5 agents):**
1. requirement-analyst
2. system-architect (recommends iOS specialists)
3. design-engineer
4. verification-agent (mandatory - Response Awareness)
5. quality-validator (mandatory - final gate)

**iOS Specialists (2-10 agents):**

system-architect analyzes requirements and detects:

| Keyword/Pattern | Recommended Specialists |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| "database", "storage", "persistence" | swiftdata-specialist or coredata-expert |
| "API", "networking", "REST" | urlsession-expert |
| "reactive", "Combine", "real-time" | combine-networking |
| "complex", "testability", "TCA" | tca-specialist |
| "performance", "slow", "optimization" | ios-performance-engineer |
| "security", "encryption", "banking" | ios-security-tester |
| "CI/CD", "deployment", "TestFlight" | xcode-cloud-expert or fastlane-specialist |
| "accessibility", "VoiceOver" | ios-accessibility-tester |

### Complexity-Based Examples

## Key Swift 6.2 Updates

### 1. Approachable Concurrency

**Old (Swift 5.9):**
```swift
@MainActor
class ViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var items: [Item] = []
}
```

**New (Swift 6.2):**
```swift
@Observable
class ViewModel {
    var items: [Item] = []  // Default MainActor isolation
}
```

### 2. @Observable State Management

**Old:**
```swift
class ViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var name = ""
    @Published var items: [Item] = []
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject private var viewModel = ViewModel()
}
```

**New:**
```swift
@Observable
class ViewModel {
    var name = ""
    var items: [Item] = []
}

struct ContentView: View {
    let viewModel = ViewModel()  // No @StateObject needed
}
```

### 3. Swift Testing Framework

**Old (XCTest):**
```swift
class ViewModelTests: XCTestCase {
    func testDataLoading() {
        XCTAssertEqual(vm.items.count, 5)
    }
}
```

**New (Swift Testing):**
```swift
@Test("Data loading populates items")
func dataLoading() async {
    #expect(vm.items.count == 5)
}
```

### 4. State-First Architecture

**Old (MVVM):**
```swift
// ViewModel layer with business logic
class ViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var items: [Item] = []

    func loadItems() { /* network call */ }
}

// View with binding
struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject private var viewModel = ViewModel()
}
```

**New (State-First):**
```swift
// Direct state management
@Observable
class AppState {
    var items: [Item] = []

    func loadItems() async { /* network call */ }
}

// View as pure function of state
struct ContentView: View {
    let state: AppState
}
```

3. ios-accessibility-tester
4. swift-testing-specialist
5. xctest-pro
6. ui-testing-expert
7. ios-debugger
8. ios-performance-engineer
9. (ios-accessibility-tester uses accessibility_audit)

### Token Efficiency:

| Operation | Without Skill | With Skill | Reduction |
|-----------|--------------|------------|-----------|
| Screen analysis | ~200 lines | ~5 lines | 97.5% |
| Test results | ~150 lines | ~8 lines | 94.7% |
| Build logs | ~500 lines | ~12 lines | 97.6% |

## Migration Checklist

### For Users

- [ ] Familiarize with 19 specialists (see QUICK_REFERENCE.md)
- [ ] Understand team composition logic (see /orca command)
- [ ] Install ios-simulator-skill (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Use `/orca` for iOS projects (automatic team selection)
- [ ] Review specialist recommendations before confirming team
- [ ] No code changes needed (backward compatible)

### For System

- [x] Backup old ios-engineer.md → `~/.claude/agents/archive/backup/`
- [x] Create 19 specialists in `~/.claude/agents/ios-specialists/`
- [x] Update `/orca` command with new team composition logic
- [x] Update QUICK_REFERENCE.md with all specialists
- [x] Update README.md with new capabilities
- [x] Create migration guide (this document)

---

## Backward Compatibility

**Old Workflow Still Works:**

The old `ios-engineer.md` is backed up but not deleted. If needed, you can manually specify:

```
/orca [request] --agents requirement-analyst,system-architect,design-engineer,ios-engineer,test-engineer,verification-agent,quality-validator
```

However, this is **not recommended**. The new specialist structure provides significantly better results.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: /orca selecting too many specialists

**Solution**: Provide clearer requirements. Example:
- Instead of: "Build iOS app"
- Use: "Build simple calculator app for iOS"

### Issue: Missing a specialist I need

**Solution**: Manually add to team during confirmation phase. /orca will present team for approval before execution.

### Issue: ios-simulator-skill not working

**Solution**:
1. Check installation: `~/.claude/skills/ios-simulator/scripts/sim_health_check.sh`
2. Verify xcodebuild-mcp installed (60 tools available)
3. Check macOS version (12+ required)
4. Review script permissions: `chmod +x ~/.claude/skills/ios-simulator/scripts/*.py`

---

## FAQ

**Q: Can I still use the old ios-engineer?**
A: Technically yes (it's backed up), but not recommended. The new specialists provide 10x better results.

**Q: How do I know which specialists to use?**
A: Use `/orca` - system-architect will automatically recommend specialists based on your requirements.

**Q: What if I disagree with specialist recommendations?**
A: /orca presents the team for approval before execution. You can modify the team during confirmation.

**Q: Do all specialists require iOS simulator?**
A: No, only 9 out of 19 use the simulator. The rest focus on code patterns, architecture, or server-side concerns.

**Q: What if my project uses Swift 5.9?**
A: Specialists include Swift 5.9 compatibility sections. They detect project Swift version and provide appropriate patterns.

**Q: How do I request a specific specialist?**
A: Include keywords in your request. Example: "optimize performance" → triggers ios-performance-engineer.
