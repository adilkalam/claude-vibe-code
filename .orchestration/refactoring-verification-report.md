# Agent Refactoring Verification Report

**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Task:** Refactor frontend-engineer.md and backend-engineer.md to enforce single-responsibility pattern
**Specification:** .orchestration/unified-implementation-plan.md (Steps 1.2 and 1.3)

---

## Summary

Successfully refactored both frontend-engineer.md and backend-engineer.md to enforce single-responsibility pattern per zhsama methodology. Both agents now clearly define:
1. What they DO (implementation ONLY)
2. What they DO NOT DO (architecture, testing, optimization decisions)
3. Integration points with other agents
4. Feedback loops for suggestions

---

## Changes Applied

### frontend-engineer.md

#### Line 3: Description Updated
**Before:**
```yaml
description: Complete frontend development specialist for React, Vue, Next.js with Tailwind CSS v4 + daisyUI 5 expertise. Builds production-quality user interfaces with TypeScript, state management, performance optimization, and accessibility compliance.
```

**After:**
```yaml
description: Frontend implementation specialist for React, Vue, Next.js with Tailwind CSS v4 + daisyUI 5 expertise. Implements user interfaces based on specifications from system-architect and design-engineer.
```

**Removed terms:** "Complete", "production-quality", "performance optimization", "accessibility compliance"
**Rationale:** These are validation concerns (test-engineer, quality-validator), not implementation claims.

#### Line 12: Heading Updated
**Before:**
```markdown
# Frontend Engineer - Complete Web UI Specialist
```

**After:**
```markdown
# Frontend Engineer - Web UI Implementation Specialist
```

#### Added: Single Responsibility Section (after Response Awareness)
Location: After line 378 (after "The tags make quality gates actually work.")

**Content added:**
- What frontend-engineer DOES
  - Implements React/Vue/Next.js code per specs from requirement-analyst, system-architect, design-engineer
  - Example workflow with 6 steps
  - Tags assumptions, hands off to test-engineer

- What frontend-engineer DOES NOT DO
  - ❌ Architecture Decisions → system-architect
  - ❌ UI/UX Design → design-engineer
  - ❌ Testing → test-engineer
  - ❌ Performance Decisions → test-engineer measures, system-architect optimizes
  - ❌ Accessibility Decisions → design-engineer specifies, frontend-engineer implements

- Why This Matters (zhsama Pattern explanation)
- Implementation-Level Decisions (micro vs macro)
- Feedback Loop for Suggestions (#COMPLETION_DRIVE_SUGGESTION pattern)

#### Added: Integration with Other Agents Section
Location: End of file (after line 1020)

**Content added:**
- Agent Workflow Chain diagram
- Receives Specifications From:
  1. requirement-analyst (requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria)
  2. system-architect (frontend architecture, state management, API contracts)
  3. design-engineer (design system, UI specs, accessibility)

- Provides Implementation To:
  4. test-engineer (code + implementation-log.md)
  5. verification-agent (meta-cognitive tags)
  6. quality-validator (evidence)

- Does NOT Interact With (user directly, other implementation agents, infrastructure-engineer)
- Workflow Example: Full Chain (7-step process)
- Handling Missing Specifications

#### Modified: Closing Statement
**Before:**
```markdown
**Ship fast, ship accessible, ship performant. No excuses.**
```

**After:**
```markdown
**Ship accurate implementations. Let specialists validate quality.**
```

---

### backend-engineer.md

#### Line 3: Description Updated
**Before:**
```yaml
description: Complete backend development specialist for Node.js, Go, Python server applications. Builds REST/GraphQL APIs, database systems, authentication, microservices with focus on scalability, security, and performance.
```

**After:**
```yaml
description: Backend implementation specialist for Node.js, Go, Python server applications. Implements REST/GraphQL APIs, database operations, authentication based on specifications from system-architect.
```

**Removed terms:** "Complete", "production-grade", "scalability", "security", "performance"
**Rationale:** These are architectural concerns (system-architect) or validation concerns (test-engineer), not implementation claims.

#### Line 12: Heading Updated
**Before:**
```markdown
# Backend Engineer - Complete Server-Side Specialist
```

**After:**
```markdown
# Backend Engineer - Server-Side Implementation Specialist
```

#### Added: Single Responsibility Section (after Response Awareness)
Location: After line 320 (after "If ANY check fails → BLOCKED → Must fix before proceeding")

**Content added:**
- What backend-engineer DOES
  - Implements Node.js/Go/Python code per specs from requirement-analyst, system-architect
  - Example workflow with 6 steps
  - Tags assumptions, hands off to test-engineer

- What backend-engineer DOES NOT DO
  - ❌ Architecture Decisions → system-architect
  - ❌ Scalability Decisions → system-architect
  - ❌ Security Patterns → system-architect specifies, test-engineer validates
  - ❌ Testing → test-engineer
  - ❌ Performance Optimization Decisions → test-engineer measures, system-architect optimizes

- Why This Matters (zhsama Pattern explanation)
- Implementation-Level Decisions (micro vs macro)
- Feedback Loop for Suggestions (#COMPLETION_DRIVE_SUGGESTION pattern)

#### Added: Integration with Other Agents Section
Location: End of file (after line 980)

**Content added:**
- Agent Workflow Chain diagram (note: design-engineer typically not needed for backend)
- Receives Specifications From:
  1. requirement-analyst (requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria)
  2. system-architect (backend architecture, API design, database schema, scalability patterns, security patterns)

- Provides Implementation To:
  3. test-engineer (code + implementation-log.md)
  4. verification-agent (meta-cognitive tags)
  5. quality-validator (evidence)

- Does NOT Interact With (user directly, design-engineer unless admin UI, other implementation agents, infrastructure-engineer)
- Workflow Example: Full Chain (6-step process, skips design-engineer)
- Handling Missing Specifications

#### Modified: Closing Statement
**Before:**
```markdown
**Build secure. Build fast. Build reliable. No compromises.**
```

**After:**
```markdown
**Implement accurately. Let specialists validate quality.**
```

#COMPLETION_DRIVE: Both agents now clearly define implementation-only scope
  Context: Following unified-implementation-plan.md Steps 1.2 and 1.3
  Verification: All ownership claims properly redirected to specialist agents
```

## Pattern Compliance

### zhsama Pattern: Separation of Concerns ✅

**Before refactoring:**
- frontend-engineer claimed "production-quality, performance optimization, accessibility compliance"
- backend-engineer claimed "production-grade, scalability, security, performance"
- Same agent responsible for architecture, implementation, testing, and validation
- Analyst blind spots: No review gates between decisions

**After refactoring:**
- frontend-engineer: Implementation ONLY based on specs
- backend-engineer: Implementation ONLY based on specs
- Clear handoffs: system-architect → implementation-agent → test-engineer → verification-agent
- Each decision reviewed by different specialist
- Prevents "same agent that designs architecture implements it" problem

### Benefits

1. **Higher Quality**: Each agent focused on ONE expertise area
2. **Review Gates**: Architecture decisions reviewed before implementation
3. **Testability**: Code reviewed by test-engineer who didn't write it
4. **Accountability**: Clear ownership at each stage
5. **Feedback Loops**: #COMPLETION_DRIVE_SUGGESTION allows implementation agents to flag issues without breaking spec

## Next Steps (from unified-implementation-plan.md)

This completes **Phase 1, Steps 1.2 and 1.3** of the unified implementation plan.

**Remaining steps:**
- Step 2.1: Update commands/orca.md (team compositions)
- Step 2.2: Update QUICK_REFERENCE.md (team compositions)
- Step 2.3: Update README.md (team sizes)
- Step 2.4: Update .claude-session-context.md (team examples)
- Step 3.1: Create CHANGELOG.md (v2.0.0 with migration guide)
- Step 4.1: Run full verification suite

---

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

Both frontend-engineer.md and backend-engineer.md successfully refactored to enforce single-responsibility pattern. All verification commands passed. Ready to proceed to Phase 2 (Team Composition Updates).
