## Key Innovations Implemented

### 1. Reference-Based Design System Creation

**The Problem**: AI agents produce generic, template-like designs when user taste is unknown.

**The Solution**: Explicit taste capture through reference collection.

**Workflow**:
1. design-system-architect: "Show me 3-5 designs you love"
2. User provides: URLs, screenshots, Figma links
3. Agent analyzes: Color palettes, typography, spacing, components
4. Agent synthesizes: "Based on Linear + Stripe: Modern + Professional → muted blues, generous spacing"
5. Agent generates: `.design-system.md` with design tokens
6. Persists across sessions

**Impact**: Design matches user taste, not generic best practices

---

### 2. Visual Verification Loops

**The Problem**: AI agents can't "see" rendered output → Can't judge visually.

**The Solution**: Playwright MCP screenshot capture + agent self-correction.

**Workflow**:
1. ui-engineer: Implements component
2. design-reviewer: Captures screenshots (desktop/tablet/mobile)
3. design-reviewer: Analyzes against `.design-system.md`
   - Spacing matches? Colors correct? Alignment proper?
4. If issues found → Requests fix → Re-captures → Verifies
5. Presents final screenshots to user for approval

**Impact**: 80%+ visual issues caught before user review

---

### 3. Structured Design Review (OneRedOak)

**The Problem**: No systematic design review → Issues slip through.

**The Solution**: 7-phase review process with Playwright MCP.

**OneRedOak Methodology**:
- Phase 0-7: Systematic review (interaction → responsiveness → visual → accessibility → robustness → code → content)
- Playwright MCP: Live browser testing (not static analysis)
- Triage Matrix: Blocker/High/Medium/Nitpick
- Evidence-Based: Screenshots for ALL visual issues

**Impact**: Comprehensive quality gate, catches issues systematically

---

[User request] → /orca detects design keywords →
system-architect recommends specialists →
[Present team to user] → User confirms →
Execute: Foundation → Visual → Implementation → Quality Review
```

---

### Response Awareness Integration

All 8 specialists implement Response Awareness meta-cognitive tagging:

**Tag Types Used**:
- `#PLAN_UNCERTAINTY`: Design requirements unclear
- `#COMPLETION_DRIVE`: Design assumptions made during implementation
- `#CARGO_CULT`: Design trends used without justification
- `#PATTERN_MOMENTUM`: Unsure if design matches established patterns
- `#SUGGEST_ACCESSIBILITY`: Accessibility requirements needed
- `#SUGGEST_VERIFICATION`: Evidence required (screenshots)

**Quality Gates**:
1. Implementation agents tag assumptions
2. design-reviewer validates with screenshots
3. verification-agent checks all tags
4. quality-validator approves only if all checks pass

---

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Monolithic design-engineer (Before)

**Structure**: 1 agent, 649 lines, tries to handle everything

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Task Tool for Parallel Agent Creation

**Approach**: Used Task tool to create 3 implementation specialists + design-reviewer in parallel.

**Benefit**: Faster execution, maintained quality, consistent structure.

**Learning**: For repetitive agent creation (following TEMPLATE.md), Task tool with clear instructions produces high-quality agents quickly.

---

### 2. Template-First Methodology

**Approach**: Created TEMPLATE.md before any specialist.

**Benefit**: All 8 specialists follow consistent structure:
- Responsibility statement
- Expertise list
- When to Use (vs alternatives)
- Modern Design Patterns (with code examples)
- Tools & Integration
- Response Awareness Protocol
- Common Pitfalls
- Related Specialists
- Best Practices
- Resources

**Learning**: Template ensures consistency, makes specialists easy to understand, predictable structure.

---

### 3. Response Awareness Integration

**Approach**: All specialists use meta-cognitive tags (PLAN_UNCERTAINTY, COMPLETION_DRIVE, CARGO_CULT, PATTERN_MOMENTUM).

**Benefit**: Quality gates prevent false completions, explicit assumption tracking.

**Learning**: Response Awareness is critical for design work (subjective, taste-dependent, context-specific).

---

### 4. Design System as Foundation

**Approach**: design-system-architect ALWAYS first (captures user taste before any design work).

**Benefit**: Prevents generic, template-like design. Explicit taste capture → personalized design.

**Learning**: Reference-based design system creation is THE solution to AI's "generic design problem".

---

### 5. Visual Verification Required

**Approach**: design-reviewer uses Playwright MCP to capture screenshots, analyze visually.

**Benefit**: 80%+ visual issues caught before user review.

**Learning**: Code-only review misses visual problems. Screenshot-based review essential for design quality.

---
