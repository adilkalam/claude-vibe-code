## Original Request

"Fix the claude-vibe-code system to correctly implement the zhsama single-responsibility pattern."

## Critical Gaps Identified by User

1. **Agent definitions violate zhsama single-responsibility pattern**
   - ios-engineer, frontend-engineer, backend-engineer are monolithic "do-everything" agents
   - Should be focused implementation specialists, not comprehensive specialists

2. **/orca team compositions are wrong**
   - Proposes minimal teams: "ios-engineer + verification-agent + quality-validator"
   - Should propose full specialized teams with 6-7 agents

3. **QUICK_REFERENCE.md contradicts /orca**
   - Lists design-engineer + test-engineer as primary iOS team members
   - /orca treats them as optional

4. **verification-agent missing from QUICK_REFERENCE.md**
   - Core to Response Awareness methodology
   - Not documented in team compositions

5. **Current approach creates exactly what zhsama proved doesn't work**
   - Monolithic spec-developer doing everything
   - Should be specialized agents for each responsibility

## Success Criteria

### Objective Requirements

1. **Agent Scope**: Each implementation agent has SINGLE responsibility: code implementation ONLY
   - NO architecture decisions
   - NO testing
   - NO design/UI/UX
   - NO deployment/CI/CD

2. **Team Compositions**: /orca proposes full specialized teams (6-7 agents minimum)
   - requirement-analyst (requirements ONLY)
   - system-architect (architecture ONLY)
   - design-engineer (design ONLY)
   - [implementation-agent] (implementation ONLY)
   - test-engineer (testing ONLY)
   - verification-agent (tag verification ONLY)
   - quality-validator (final validation ONLY)

3. **Documentation Consistency**: All sources consistent
   - /orca team listings
   - QUICK_REFERENCE.md team listings
   - Agent definition scopes

4. **Verification**: 100% of changes verified with evidence

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Each implementation agent definition contains ONLY implementation responsibilities
- [ ] /orca proposes 6-7 agent teams for each project type
- [ ] QUICK_REFERENCE.md matches /orca exactly
- [ ] verification-agent documented in all team compositions
- [ ] verification-report.md shows 100% verification
- [ ] quality-validator approves with evidence
- [ ] User confirms fix addresses all 5 gaps
