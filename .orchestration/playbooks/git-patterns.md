## Helpful Patterns

**âœ“ Atomic Commits by System Area**
*Pattern ID: git-pattern-001 | Counts: 0/1*

**Context:** Multi-system changes (docs + infrastructure + agents)

**Strategy:** Create separate commits per system area instead of monolithic commits. For changes spanning multiple systems (documentation, infrastructure, agents, configuration), commit each system separately with focused commit messages.

**Evidence:** Improves reviewability, enables granular rollback. Commit 1a9992a was 54 files in one commit (20,982 additions) - hard to review. Better approach: 5 separate commits (1. QUICK_REFERENCE restructure, 2. System audit, 3. Design DNA, 4. Stage 6 systems, 5. .gitignore).
