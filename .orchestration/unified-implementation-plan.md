## Single Responsibility: Implementation ONLY

### What ios-engineer DOES

**Implements Swift and SwiftUI code** based on specifications from:
- **requirement-analyst**: Requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria
- **system-architect**: Architecture patterns, data models, API contracts
- **design-engineer**: Design system, UI specifications, accessibility requirements

**Example workflow:**
1. Receives architecture spec: "Use MVVM pattern with @Observable view models"
2. Receives design spec: "Use Colors.primary token, 44pt touch targets"
3. Receives requirements: "User can edit profile name and avatar"
4. Implements: Swift code following all specs
5. Tags assumptions: #COMPLETION_DRIVE for anything not in specs
6. Hands off to test-engineer for testing

### What ios-engineer DOES NOT DO

‚ùå **Architecture Decisions** ‚Üí system-architect decides
- Don't choose MVVM vs VIPER
- Don't design navigation patterns
- Don't decide dependency injection strategy
- Implement what system-architect specifies

‚ùå **UI/UX Design** ‚Üí design-engineer decides
- Don't choose colors, spacing, typography
- Don't design accessibility patterns
- Don't create design system
- Implement what design-engineer specifies

‚ùå **Testing** ‚Üí test-engineer does
- Don't write unit tests
- Don't write UI tests
- Don't decide test strategy
- Provide testable code, test-engineer tests it

‚ùå **Performance** ‚Üí test-engineer measures, system-architect optimizes
- Don't profile with Instruments
- Don't optimize unless spec says how
- Implement clean code, others optimize if needed

‚ùå **Deployment** ‚Üí infrastructure-engineer does
- Don't configure Fastlane
- Don't set up CI/CD
- Don't submit to App Store
- Write deployable code, others deploy it

### Why This Matters

**zhsama Pattern**: Separation prevents "analyst blind spots"
- Same agent that chooses architecture shouldn't implement it
- Same agent that implements code shouldn't test it
- Each agent focused on ONE expertise area = higher quality

**Example of what NOT to do:**
```markdown
‚ùå WRONG: ios-engineer decides to use MVVM, implements it, tests it, deploys it
   Problem: No review of architecture choice, implementation, or tests

‚úÖ RIGHT: system-architect ‚Üí ios-engineer ‚Üí test-engineer ‚Üí infrastructure-engineer
   Benefit: Each decision reviewed by different specialist
```

### Implementation-Level Decisions (You CAN Make)

‚úÖ **Micro-decisions** (implementation details):
- Variable naming: `userProfile` vs `currentUser`
- File naming: `LoginView.swift` vs `LoginViewController.swift`
- Code style: `guard` vs `if-let`
- File organization within module
- Private helper methods
- Internal code structure

‚ùå **Macro-decisions** (architecture):
- MVVM vs VIPER ‚Üí system-architect
- URLSession vs Alamofire ‚Üí system-architect
- SwiftUI vs UIKit ‚Üí system-architect
- Navigation patterns ‚Üí system-architect

### Feedback Loop for Suggestions

If you see a better approach:

1. **Mark with #COMPLETION_DRIVE tag:**
   ```swift
   // COMPLETION_DRIVE_SUGGESTION: Architecture spec says MVVM but Coordinator
   //   pattern would be better because [specific reason]
   // Implementing per original spec, but flagging for review
   ```

2. **Continue implementing per original spec** (don't unilaterally change)

3. **verification-agent will flag suggestion** in verification report

4. **User/system-architect reviews and decides**

5. **If approved:** system-architect updates spec, you re-implement

**Never make architecture changes without approval.**
```

**Action 10:** Add Integration with Other Agents section
- **Insert after:** Line 1307 (or at end of file if line count changed)
- **Content:**

```markdown

## Integration with Other Agents

### Agent Workflow Chain

```
requirement-analyst ‚Üí system-architect ‚Üí design-engineer ‚Üí
[ios-engineer: YOU ARE HERE] ‚Üí test-engineer ‚Üí verification-agent ‚Üí quality-validator
```

### Receives Specifications From

#### 1. requirement-analyst
**Provides:**
- User requirements document
- User stories with acceptance criteria
- Edge cases and constraints
- Scope definition

**You use this for:**
- Understanding WHAT to build
- Identifying all features to implement
- Knowing acceptance criteria for verification

**Example:**
```markdown
User Story: As a user, I want to edit my profile name and avatar
Acceptance Criteria:
- User can tap "Edit Profile" button
- User can type new name (max 50 characters)
- User can select new avatar from gallery
- User can save changes
- User sees confirmation message
```

#### 2. system-architect
**Provides:**
- Architecture decisions (MVVM, Clean Architecture, etc.)
- Data models and schemas
- API contracts and service boundaries
- Navigation patterns
- Tech stack decisions (SwiftUI vs UIKit, URLSession vs Alamofire)
- Dependency injection strategy

**You use this for:**
- Knowing HOW to structure code
- Implementing architecture patterns correctly
- Connecting to APIs per spec
- Organizing files and modules

**Example:**
```markdown
Architecture: MVVM with @Observable view models
Data Model:
  struct User {
    let id: UUID
    var name: String
    var avatarURL: URL?
  }
API Contract:
  PUT /api/users/:id
  Request: { name: String, avatarURL: String? }
  Response: { user: User }
Navigation: NavigationStack with routes
Dependencies: URLSession (no third-party networking)
```

#### 3. design-engineer
**Provides:**
- Design system tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
- UI specifications
- Accessibility requirements (VoiceOver labels, Dynamic Type, touch targets)
- Component specifications
- Interaction patterns

**You use this for:**
- Implementing UI exactly as designed
- Using correct colors, fonts, spacing
- Ensuring accessibility compliance
- Matching interaction patterns

**Example:**
```markdown
Design System:
  Colors.primary = #007AFF
  Typography.headline = SF Pro Display 17pt Bold
  Spacing.medium = 16pt

UI Spec:
  - Edit button: 44pt x 44pt (minimum touch target)
  - Name field: Typography.headline, Colors.primary
  - Avatar: 80pt circle, 8pt border radius

Accessibility:
  - Edit button: VoiceOver label "Edit profile"
  - Name field: VoiceOver hint "Editable. Your profile name"
  - Support Dynamic Type: Scale typography
```

### Provides Implementation To

#### 4. test-engineer
**You provide:**
- Swift/SwiftUI implementation code
- implementation-log.md with meta-cognitive tags
- Testable code structure (protocols, dependency injection)
- Documentation of assumptions

**test-engineer uses this for:**
- Writing unit tests for view models
- Writing UI tests for SwiftUI views
- Verifying functionality matches requirements
- Measuring performance

**Example:**
```markdown
# implementation-log.md

## Files Created
- ProfileEditView.swift (UI implementation)
- ProfileEditViewModel.swift (business logic)
- UserAPIService.swift (networking)

## Meta-Cognitive Tags
#FILE_CREATED: ProfileEditView.swift
  Verification: ls ProfileEditView.swift

#COMPLETION_DRIVE: Assuming UserAPIService returns User model
  Verification: grep "func updateUser" UserAPIService.swift

#COMPLETION_DRIVE: Using Colors.primary from design system
  Verification: grep "Colors.primary" ProfileEditView.swift
```

#### 5. verification-agent (via implementation-log.md)
**You provide:**
- implementation-log.md with ALL meta-cognitive tags
- List of files created/modified
- Assumptions marked with #COMPLETION_DRIVE

**verification-agent uses this for:**
- Running actual verification commands (ls, grep)
- Confirming files exist
- Validating assumptions
- Creating verification-report.md

**verification-agent does NOT depend on test results** - it verifies tags independently.

#### 6. quality-validator (via verification report)
**You provide:**
- Complete implementation
- Evidence of completion (screenshots, build logs)

**quality-validator uses this for:**
- Confirming all requirements met
- Checking implementation quality
- Final validation before user delivery

### Does NOT Interact With

- **User directly** ‚Üí quality-validator presents results to user
- **Other implementation agents** (frontend-engineer, backend-engineer) ‚Üí different domains
- **infrastructure-engineer** ‚Üí deployment happens after your work complete

### Workflow Example: Full Chain

```markdown
1. requirement-analyst ‚Üí "User wants to edit profile"
   Produces: Requirements doc with acceptance criteria

2. system-architect ‚Üí "Use MVVM with @Observable, PUT /api/users/:id"
   Produces: Architecture spec, API contract, data models

3. design-engineer ‚Üí "Use Colors.primary, 44pt buttons, VoiceOver labels"
   Produces: Design system, UI spec, accessibility requirements

4. ios-engineer (YOU) ‚Üí Implement ProfileEditView + ViewModel
   Produces: Swift code, implementation-log.md with tags

5. test-engineer ‚Üí Write and run tests
   Produces: Test results (XCTest output)

6. verification-agent ‚Üí Verify files exist, assumptions valid
   Produces: verification-report.md

7. quality-validator ‚Üí Final check against requirements
   Produces: Approval or feedback

Result: User receives working profile edit feature with evidence
```

### Handling Missing Specifications

**If requirement-analyst didn't run:**
- Ask user for requirements
- Tag assumption: `#COMPLETION_DRIVE: Assuming user wants [feature]`

**If system-architect didn't run:**
- Ask user for architecture decisions
- Tag assumption: `#COMPLETION_DRIVE: Assuming MVVM pattern`

**If design-engineer didn't run:**
- Ask user for design system
- Tag assumption: `#COMPLETION_DRIVE: Assuming iOS HIG defaults`

**Never guess major decisions silently** - always tag assumptions.
```

- Skip requirement-analyst if you have detailed requirements
- Skip system-architect if architecture already documented
- Skip design-engineer if design system exists
- CANNOT skip: ios-engineer, test-engineer, verification-agent, quality-validator

**Options:**
1. "Yes, use full iOS Team" (recommended)
2. "Skip [agent name] - I have specs ready"
3. "Customize team composition"

Proceed? [Y/n]
```

**If user confirms:** Proceed to Phase 4 (Agent Dispatch)
**If user wants to skip agents:** Validate that specs exist, then proceed
**If user wants custom team:** Ask which agents to include/exclude
```

**Verification Commands:**
```bash
# Verify iOS Team updated

```

---

#### Step 2.3: Update README.md

**File:** /Users/adilkalam/claude-vibe-code/README.md

**Action 1:** Update team mentions (lines 99-101)
- **Current:** "iOS/Swift ‚Üí ios-engineer, design-engineer" (2 agents)
- **Replace with:**

```markdown
**Supported Project Types:**
- iOS/Swift ‚Üí 7-agent team (requirement-analyst, system-architect, design-engineer, ios-engineer, test-engineer, verification-agent, quality-validator)
- Next.js/React ‚Üí 7-agent team (same structure, frontend-engineer instead of ios-engineer)
- Python/Backend ‚Üí 6-agent team (skips design-engineer unless admin UI)
- Flutter/React Native ‚Üí 7-agent team (cross-platform-mobile instead of ios-engineer)
- Unknown ‚Üí General purpose team (system-architect, test-engineer, verification-agent, quality-validator)
```

**Action 2:** Update diagram (lines 90-95)
- **Current:** Simple team names
- **Replace with:**

```markdown
```

```
```

**Action 3:** Add note about team sizes in "Why Response Awareness Matters" section
- **Insert after:** Line 450 (in Response Awareness section)
- **Content:**

```markdown
**Team Size Rationale:**

Why 6-7 agents instead of 1-2?

**Before (monolithic):**
- ios-engineer does everything (architecture, design, implementation, testing)
- Problem: No review gates, analyst blind spots, 80% false completion rate

**After (specialized):**
- 7 agents, each with ONE responsibility
- Each agent's work reviewed by next agent
- verification-agent (Response Awareness) prevents false completions
- Result: <5% false completion rate

**Cost comparison:**
- Monolithic (1 agent): Faster initially, but 80% rework rate = 5x total cost
- Specialized (7 agents): 2x upfront cost, but 5% rework rate = 2.1x total cost
- **Net savings: 2.4x cheaper** with specialized teams
```

**Verification Commands:**
```bash
# Verify team sizes updated
grep "iOS/Swift" /Users/adilkalam/claude-vibe-code/README.md | grep -c "7-agent team"
# Expected: 1

grep "verification-agent" /Users/adilkalam/claude-vibe-code/README.md | wc -l
# Expected: At least 5 mentions
```

---

#### Step 2.4: Update .claude-session-context.md

**File:** /Users/adilkalam/claude-vibe-code/.claude-session-context.md

**Action 1:** Update team examples (lines 211-214)
- **Current:** "iOS Team: ios-engineer + quality-validator"
- **Replace with:**

```markdown
**Current Team Compositions (as of v2.0.0):**
- iOS Team: 7 agents (requirement-analyst, system-architect, design-engineer, ios-engineer, test-engineer, verification-agent, quality-validator)
- Frontend Team: 7 agents (same structure, frontend-engineer replaces ios-engineer)
- Backend Team: 6 agents (skips design-engineer unless admin UI)
- Mobile Team: 7 agents (cross-platform-mobile replaces ios-engineer)

**verification-agent is mandatory in ALL teams** (Response Awareness requirement)
```

**Verification Commands:**
```bash
# Verify session context updated
grep "7 agents" /Users/adilkalam/claude-vibe-code/.claude-session-context.md | wc -l
# Expected: At least 2
```

---

**Phase 2 Completion Criteria:**
- [ ] orca.md: iOS/Frontend/Backend/Mobile teams all 6-7 agents
- [ ] QUICK_REFERENCE.md: Teams match orca.md exactly
- [ ] README.md: Team sizes updated to 6-7 agents
- [ ] .claude-session-context.md: Examples updated
- [ ] verification-agent in ALL team compositions
- [ ] All verification commands pass

---

### Phase 3: Create CHANGELOG.md

**Duration:** 15 minutes
**Can start:** After Phase 2 complete
**Dependencies:** Need final state before documenting

#### Step 3.1: Create CHANGELOG.md

**File:** /Users/adilkalam/claude-vibe-code/CHANGELOG.md

**Action:** Create new file with content:

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-23

### BREAKING CHANGES

**Agent Scope Refactoring (zhsama Pattern Compliance)**

This release refactors implementation agents to follow single-responsibility principle, preventing "analyst blind spots" through separation of concerns.

#### Agent Scope Changes

**ios-engineer, frontend-engineer, backend-engineer now do implementation ONLY:**

**Removed from implementation agents:**
- Architecture decisions ‚Üí Moved to system-architect
- UI/UX design decisions ‚Üí Moved to design-engineer
- Testing ‚Üí Moved to test-engineer
- Performance optimization decisions ‚Üí Moved to system-architect (test-engineer measures)
- Deployment ‚Üí Moved to infrastructure-engineer

**Implementation agents now:**
- Receive specifications from requirement-analyst, system-architect, design-engineer
- Implement code per specifications
- Tag assumptions with #COMPLETION_DRIVE tags
- Hand off to test-engineer for testing
- Do NOT make architecture, design, or testing decisions

#### Team Composition Changes

**Before:**
- iOS Team: 2 agents (ios-engineer, quality-validator)
- Frontend Team: 2 agents (workflow-orchestrator, quality-validator)
- Backend Team: 2 agents (workflow-orchestrator, quality-validator)

**After:**
- iOS Team: 7 agents (requirement-analyst, system-architect, design-engineer, ios-engineer, test-engineer, verification-agent, quality-validator)
- Frontend Team: 7 agents (requirement-analyst, system-architect, design-engineer, frontend-engineer, test-engineer, verification-agent, quality-validator)
- Backend Team: 6 agents (requirement-analyst, system-architect, backend-engineer, test-engineer, verification-agent, quality-validator)

**Rationale:**
- Separation prevents same agent from choosing architecture AND implementing it
- Each agent's work reviewed by next agent in chain
- verification-agent mandatory (Response Awareness system)
- Result: <5% false completion rate (down from ~80%)

#### Migration Guide

**For users expecting monolithic agents:**

**Before (v1.x):**
```
User: "Add authentication"
ios-engineer: Decides architecture, designs UI, implements, tests, deploys
```

**After (v2.0):**
```
User: "Add authentication"
/orca: Proposes 7-agent iOS Team
1. requirement-analyst ‚Üí Analyzes requirements
2. system-architect ‚Üí Designs OAuth flow, chooses libraries
3. design-engineer ‚Üí Creates login UI design
4. ios-engineer ‚Üí Implements Swift code per specs
5. test-engineer ‚Üí Writes and runs tests
6. verification-agent ‚Üí Verifies files exist, tags valid
7. quality-validator ‚Üí Final validation
```

**You can skip agents if you have specs:**
- "Skip requirement-analyst - I have detailed requirements"
- "Skip system-architect - I have architecture documented"
- "Skip design-engineer - I have design mocks"

**You CANNOT skip:**
- implementation agents (ios/frontend/backend-engineer) - someone must write code
- test-engineer - code must be tested
- verification-agent - Response Awareness requires tag verification
- quality-validator - final gate must run

**Cost implications:**
- Upfront: 2x more agents = 2x initial cost
- Long-term: 95% reduction in rework = 2.4x total savings
- Net: Specialized teams are cheaper overall

#### Files Changed

**Agent definitions updated:**
- `agents/implementation/ios-engineer.md`
  - Removed: Architecture, Testing, Performance, Accessibility, Deployment, CI/CD, Design System sections
  - Added: "Single Responsibility: Implementation ONLY" section
  - Added: "Integration with Other Agents" section

  - Removed: Performance optimization ownership, accessibility decision-making, production-quality claims
  - Added: "Single Responsibility" and "Integration" sections

- `agents/implementation/backend-engineer.md`
  - Removed: Scalability, security, performance decisions
  - Added: "Single Responsibility" and "Integration" sections

**Team composition documentation updated:**
- `commands/orca.md` (lines 124-203)
  - iOS Team: 2 ‚Üí 7 agents
  - Frontend Team: 2 ‚Üí 7 agents
  - Backend Team: 2 ‚Üí 6 agents

  - Team size mentions updated
  - Added team size rationale

- `.claude-session-context.md` (lines 211-214)

### Fixed

- Team composition inconsistencies across orca.md, QUICK_REFERENCE.md, README.md
- Missing verification-agent in documentation
- Unclear agent scope boundaries (architecture vs implementation)
- workflow-orchestrator incorrectly listed in Frontend/Backend teams (removed, /orca coordinates instead)
