# Routine System Philosophy

## Overview

A **Routine** is the "source code" for a process—a structured, step-by-step plan that guides AI agents through complex workflows with mechanical reliability. The routine system is built on research-backed principles that transform agent planning from an unpredictable art into a reliable engineering discipline.

## The Core Problem: Unreliable Agent Plans

Standard LLM-generated plans suffer from fundamental weaknesses:

### Problem 1: Ambiguous Natural Language

**Issue**: Plans written as natural language paragraphs are difficult for execution engines to interpret reliably.

**Example**:
```
"First, check if the user provided a ticket ID, then get the schema
and planning context, generate the JSON, and submit it."
```

**Failure Mode**: Execution engine misinterprets step boundaries, tool requirements, or conditional logic.

---

### Problem 2: Execution Instability

**Issue**: Models without structured plans have dramatically lower execution accuracy.

**Research Finding**: GPT-4 execution accuracy drops from 96% with structured routines to 41% without them.

**Failure Modes**:
- Missing steps in complex workflows
- Calling tools in wrong order
- Getting lost in branching logic
- Improper termination

---

### Problem 3: Unverifiable Ephemeral Plans

**Issue**: Unstructured plans exist only during execution and cannot be reviewed or improved.

**Consequences**:
- No human review for correctness
- No systematic improvement over time
- No auditability for compliance
- No version control for evolution

---

## The Routine Solution: Structured Syntax

Pantheon Routines solve these problems through **rigid structural syntax** based on node types.

### Design Principle 1: Eliminating Ambiguity

**Solution**: Machine-parseable syntax with explicit step boundaries

**Format**:
```
Step {num}. **{Name}:** {Description}. Use `{tool}`
```

**Benefits**:
- Clear separation between steps
- Explicit tool-to-step mapping
- No execution engine interpretation required

**Example**:
```markdown
Step 2. **Get schema:** Retrieve JSON schema for implementation plans.
Use `pantheon get schema update-plan --actor <your_agent_name>`
```

The execution engine knows exactly:
- Step number (2)
- Step purpose (Get schema)
- Required action (Retrieve JSON schema)
- Tool to invoke (pantheon get schema update-plan)

---

### Design Principle 2: Ensuring Execution Stability

**Solution**: Explicit step sequencing with termination guarantees

**Node Types**:
- `node`: Standard sequential step
- `branch`: Decision point with conditional paths
- `branchstartnode`: First step in branch path (condition + action)
- `branchnode`: Continuation step within branch
- `branchfinishnode`: Terminating step within branch
- `finish`: Terminal step ending workflow

**Benefits**:
- Agent follows explicit "track" through workflow
- Branching logic clearly defined
- Guaranteed termination points
- No ambiguity about step order

**Example**:
```markdown
Step 1 (branch). **Check ticket availability:** Perform a branch condition check. Validate required ticket id:
    - Branch 1-1 Step 1. **Continue:** If ticket id was provided, then get the schema needed for update-plan. Use `pantheon get schema update-plan --actor <your_agent_name>`.
    - Branch 1-2 Step 1. **Ask for ticket id:** If ticket id was not provided, then report to the user that a ticket id is required.
    - Branch 1-2 Step 2 (finish). **Stop:** Explain that a ticket id is required before proceeding. You are now done.
```

The agent understands:
- Two possible paths exist
- Path 1-1 continues workflow
- Path 1-2 terminates workflow
- Exactly when to stop

---

### Design Principle 3: Enabling Verifiability

**Solution**: Version-controlled, human-readable Markdown format

**Benefits**:
- Routines are auditable artifacts
- Humans can review for correctness
- Systematic improvement through iteration
- Compliance validation possible
- Knowledge preserved in repository

**Example Evolution**:
```markdown
# Version 1.0
Step 1. **Get schema:** Use `pantheon get schema update-plan`

# Version 1.1 (improved after feedback)
Step 1. **Get schema:** Retrieve JSON schema for implementation plans,
paying special attention to required fields.
Use `pantheon get schema update-plan --actor <your_agent_name>`
```

The routine becomes a **living document** that improves based on real-world execution feedback.

## The Routine-Schema Partnership

Routines work hand-in-hand with process schemas to provide complete guidance.

### Two Complementary Roles

**The Routine** (Procedural Guidance):
- **Purpose**: Guides agent's cognitive process
- **Content**: Step-by-step "how to think" instructions
- **Format**: Structured Markdown with node types
- **Role**: Chain of thought guidance

**The Schema** (Structural Contract):
- **Purpose**: Defines data structure and validation rules
- **Content**: JSON Schema with type definitions
- **Format**: Jsonnet for dynamic composition
- **Role**: Validation target for output

### Division of Responsibility

| Aspect | Routine Handles | Schema Handles |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Workflow steps | ✓ | ✗ |
| Cognitive guidance | ✓ | ✗ |
| Tool invocation | ✓ | ✗ |
| Data structure | ✗ | ✓ |
| Validation rules | ✗ | ✓ |
| Type definitions | ✗ | ✓ |

### Example Partnership

**Routine** guides reasoning:
```markdown
Step 3. **Generate JSON content:** Create the full JSON object in-memory,
ensuring it strictly follows the retrieved schema. Include implementation
steps, dependencies, and effort estimates.
```

**Schema** validates structure:
```jsonnet
{
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    implementation_steps: {
      type: 'array',
      items: { type: 'string' },
      description: 'Ordered list of implementation steps'
    },
    dependencies: {
      type: 'string',
      description: 'Dependencies and prerequisites'
    },
    estimated_effort: {
      type: 'string',
      description: 'Time estimate for completion'
    }
  },
  required: ['implementation_steps']
}
```

Together they ensure:
- Agent knows **how** to create the data (routine)
- Agent knows **what** structure to create (schema)
- Framework can validate the result (schema)

---

## Cognitive Steps vs Tool Steps

### The Distinction

Not every routine step requires a tool call. The most important steps often guide **internal reasoning**.

**Cognitive Step** (No tool):
```markdown
Step 3. **Generate JSON content:** Create the full JSON object in-memory,
ensuring it strictly follows the retrieved schema.
```

**Tool Step** (Requires tool):
```markdown
Step 4. **Get temp file path:** Obtain absolute path for temporary JSON
file creation to ensure atomic operations.
Use `pantheon get tempfile --process update-plan --actor <your_agent_name>`
```

### Workflow Pattern

The routine system enables a powerful pattern:

1. **Cognitive Steps**: Guide agent through design/reasoning process
2. **Assembly**: Agent constructs complete solution in memory
3. **Validation**: Agent validates against schema
4. **Submission**: Single tool call with complete, valid data

### Example: build-process Workflow

```markdown
Step 1. **Analyze requirements:** Examine the build specification to
understand artifact structure, sections, and build mode requirements.

Step 2. **Design process family:** Determine which processes to generate
(CREATE, GET, UPDATE) based on artifact complexity and build mode.

Step 3. **Plan schema composition:** Design how section schemas will merge
for CREATE process and compose for UPDATE process.

Step 4. **Generate build plan:** Assemble complete JSON object with all
process definitions, templates, and configurations.

Step 5 (finish). **Submit build:** Execute the build process with
complete specification.
Use `pantheon execute build-team-artifact --from-file {tempfile} --actor <your_agent_name>`
```

Notice:
- Steps 1-4: Cognitive guidance (no tools)
- Step 5: Single atomic submission
- Agent guided through complex reasoning
- Framework receives complete, validated data

## Research Foundation

The Pantheon routine system is based on the paper:

**"Routine: A Structural Planning Framework for LLM Agent System in Enterprise"**

### Key Findings

1. **Structured plans improve accuracy**: 96% vs 41% for GPT-4
2. **Node-based syntax eliminates ambiguity**: Clear step boundaries prevent misinterpretation
3. **Explicit termination prevents infinite loops**: Finish nodes guarantee completion
4. **Branching support enables complex logic**: Conditional paths handle real-world scenarios

### Practical Implications

These findings directly influenced routine design:

- **Six node types** for complete workflow expression
- **Explicit termination** via finish nodes
- **Branch notation** (Branch 1-1 Step 2) for clear path tracking
- **One instruction per step** to prevent command bundling

---

## Glass Box Philosophy Alignment

Routines embody the Glass Box philosophy:

### Transparency Over Opacity

**Traditional Approach**: Agent plans hidden in prompt engineering

**Routine Approach**: Every decision visible in version-controlled Markdown

### Mechanical Reliability Over Prompt Elegance

**Traditional Approach**: Clever prompts that drift over time

**Routine Approach**: Structured processes with guaranteed behavior

### Systematic Learning Over Ad-hoc Fixes

**Traditional Approach**: Prompt tweaking based on failures

**Routine Approach**: Routine versioning with documented improvements

---

## Common Misconceptions

### Misconception 1: "Routines Are Too Rigid"

**Reality**: Structure enables flexibility through composition

Rigid syntax → Reliable execution → Composable workflows → Complex capabilities

### Misconception 2: "Natural Language Is More Intuitive"

**Reality**: Natural language is intuitive for humans, ambiguous for machines

Structured routines optimize for **machine reliability** while maintaining **human readability**

### Misconception 3: "Every Step Needs a Tool"

**Reality**: Cognitive steps are often more important than tool steps

Best routines guide **reasoning** first, then submit **complete solutions**

---

## Design Guidelines

When creating routines:

### 1. One Instruction Per Step

**Bad**:
```markdown
Step 1. **Setup:** Get schema, retrieve context, and generate JSON.
```

**Good**:
```markdown
Step 1. **Get schema:** Retrieve JSON schema for implementation plans.
Step 2. **Retrieve context:** Gather current ticket metadata.
Step 3. **Generate JSON:** Create complete data object in memory.
```

---

### 2. Explicit Termination

**Bad**:
```markdown
Step 5. **Submit plan:** Execute update-plan process.
```

**Good**:
```markdown
Step 5 (finish). **Submit plan:** Execute file-based plan submission.
Use `pantheon execute update-plan --from-file {tempfile} --actor <your_agent_name>`.
You are now done. Stop.
```

---

### 3. Clear Branch Conditions

**Bad**:
```markdown
If there's a ticket ID, get schema, otherwise ask for one.
```

**Good**:
```markdown
Step 1 (branch). **Check ticket availability:** Validate required ticket id:
    - Branch 1-1 Step 1. **Continue:** If ticket id was provided, then get schema.
    - Branch 1-2 Step 1. **Ask for ticket id:** If ticket id was not provided, then report requirement to user.
    - Branch 1-2 Step 2 (finish). **Stop:** Explain ticket id requirement. You are now done.
```

## Summary

The routine system philosophy is built on three pillars:

1. **Structured Syntax**: Eliminates ambiguity through explicit node types
2. **Routine-Schema Partnership**: Separates cognitive guidance from validation
3. **Research-Backed Design**: 96% execution accuracy vs 41% for unstructured plans

By treating routines as **version-controlled source code** for agent workflows, Pantheon transforms AI agent reliability from a prompt engineering challenge into a software engineering discipline.

The result: Mechanical reliability, systematic improvement, and complete auditability—core tenets of the Glass Box philosophy.
