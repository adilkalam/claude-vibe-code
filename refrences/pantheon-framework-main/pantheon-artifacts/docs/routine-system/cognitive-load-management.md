# Cognitive Load Management

Complex tasks can overwhelm agent reasoning capacity. This document covers techniques for breaking down complexity and managing cognitive load in routine instructions.

## Understanding Cognitive Load

**Definition:** The mental effort required to process instructions and make decisions.

**Impact on Agents:**
- High cognitive load → Poor decisions, missed steps, errors
- Managed cognitive load → Reliable execution, quality outputs
- Low cognitive load → Fast, accurate completion

**Goal:** Structure routines to minimize cognitive load while maximizing decision quality.

## Load Reduction Techniques

### Technique 1: Sequential Decomposition

**Principle:** Break complex tasks into sequential, focused steps.

**Bad (High Load):**
```markdown
Step 2. **Complete Analysis:** Analyze the business context, evaluate technical approaches, identify risks, estimate effort, and document your reasoning.
```

**Good (Managed Load):**
```markdown
Step 2. **Analyze Business Context:** Review the business need:
- What problem needs solving?
- Who are the stakeholders?
- What is the success criteria?

Step 3. **Evaluate Technical Approaches:** Consider implementation options:
- List viable technical approaches
- Evaluate pros and cons of each
- Select the approach that best fits requirements

Step 4. **Identify Risks:** Document potential issues:
- Technical risks and mitigation strategies
- Dependency risks and contingency plans
- Timeline risks and buffer zones

Step 5. **Estimate Effort:** Provide effort estimation:
- Break down into implementation phases
- Estimate time for each phase
- Add buffer for unknowns
```

**Benefits:**
- Focus on one cognitive task at a time
- Clear substep structure
- Manageable decision points

### Technique 2: Chunking Related Information

**Principle:** Group related substeps into logical chunks.

**Pattern:**
```markdown
Step N. **Task Name:** [Overall guidance]
- [Related substep 1]
- [Related substep 2]
- [Related substep 3]

Step N+1. **Next Task:** [Next guidance]
- [Different substeps]
```

**Example:**
```markdown
Step 2. **Gather Context:** Collect information needed for planning:
- Review existing system architecture
- Identify affected components
- Document current behavior
- Note integration points

Step 3. **Design Solution:** Create implementation approach:
- Define desired end state
- Outline modification strategy
- Specify testing approach
- Document rollback plan
```

**Benefits:**
- Related information grouped
- Natural cognitive flow
- Clear transitions between tasks

### Technique 3: Progressive Refinement

**Principle:** Start broad, then refine details.

**Pattern:**
```markdown
Step N. **Draft [Artifact]:** Create initial version:
- High-level structure
- Key components
- Main flow

Step N+1. **Review [Artifact]:** Evaluate draft:
- Check completeness
- Verify logic
- Identify gaps

Step N+2. **Refine [Artifact]:** Add detail and polish:
- Fill in missing details
- Clarify ambiguous points
- Validate against requirements
```

**Example:**
```markdown
Step 3. **Draft Implementation Plan:** Create initial plan outline:
- List major phases
- Identify key milestones
- Note critical dependencies

Step 4. **Review Plan Quality:** Evaluate plan completeness:
- All requirements addressed?
- Dependencies captured?
- Effort estimates reasonable?

Step 5. **Refine Implementation Plan:** Enhance plan with details:
- Break phases into specific steps
- Add testing checkpoints
- Clarify acceptance criteria
```

**Benefits:**
- Iterative approach reduces initial load
- Opportunity for self-correction
- Higher quality final output

## Cognitive Guidance Patterns

### Pattern 1: Structured Questions

**Use When:** Agent needs to consider multiple factors

**Template:**
```markdown
Step N. **Task Name:** [Description]. Consider:
- [Question 1]?
- [Question 2]?
- [Question 3]?
```

**Example:**
```markdown
Step 2. **Evaluate Technical Feasibility:** Assess implementation viability:
- Do we have the required expertise?
- Are necessary tools and libraries available?
- What is the implementation complexity?
- Are there performance concerns?
- What testing infrastructure is needed?
```

**Benefits:**
- Provides thinking framework
- Ensures thorough consideration
- Reduces chance of overlooking factors

### Pattern 2: Decision Matrix

**Use When:** Choosing between alternatives

**Template:**
```markdown
Step N. **Select [Choice]:** Choose best option:
1. List alternatives
2. Evaluate each against criteria:
   - Criterion 1
   - Criterion 2
   - Criterion 3
3. Select option that best balances trade-offs
4. Document selection rationale
```

**Example:**
```markdown
Step 3. **Select Architecture Pattern:** Choose appropriate pattern:
1. List viable patterns (microservices, monolith, serverless)
2. Evaluate each against requirements:
   - Scalability needs
   - Development complexity
   - Operational overhead
   - Time to market
3. Select pattern that best fits project constraints
4. Document why this pattern was chosen
```

**Benefits:**
- Systematic evaluation
- Trade-off visibility
- Documented reasoning

### Pattern 3: Validation Checklist

**Use When:** Ensuring completeness or quality

**Template:**
```markdown
Step N. **Validate [Artifact]:** Check quality:
- [ ] Criterion 1 met
- [ ] Criterion 2 met
- [ ] Criterion 3 met
- [ ] No issues identified
```

**Example:**
```markdown
Step 5. **Validate Implementation Plan:** Verify plan quality:
- [ ] All requirements addressed
- [ ] Dependencies identified
- [ ] Testing approach defined
- [ ] Effort estimates provided
- [ ] Risks documented
- [ ] Acceptance criteria clear
```

**Benefits:**
- Concrete validation steps
- Reduced ambiguity
- Quality assurance

## Managing Complex Branching

### Pattern: Simplified Decision Points

**Bad (High Load):**
```markdown
Step 1. Check if ID is provided and valid format and ticket exists and user has permission, then proceed with update after validating schema and checking file permissions, otherwise ask for correct ID or explain permission issue or file access problem.
```

**Good (Managed Load):**
```markdown
Step 1 (branch). **Validate Prerequisites:** Check required conditions:
- Branch 1-1 Step 1. **Proceed:** If all prerequisites met, get schema. Use `pantheon get schema update-plan`.
- Branch 1-2 Step 1 (finish). **Request Missing Info:** If prerequisites not met, report which items are missing. You are now done.

Step 2. **Retrieve Context:** Get current ticket data. Use `pantheon execute get-ticket --id {ticket_id}`.
```

**Benefits:**
- Single decision point
- Clear paths
- Reduced complexity

## Section-Based Cognitive Management

### Pattern: Section-Specific Instructions

**Use When:** UPDATE processes handle multiple sections

**Approach:** Create focused routine fragments per section

**Main Routine:**
```jinja2
Step 1. **Select Sections:** You will process: {{ pantheon_sections | join(', ') }}.

{% for section in pantheon_sections %}
    {% include 'routine/sections/' ~ section ~ '.md' with context %}
{% endfor %}

Step {{ pantheon_routine_step.num }} (finish). **Complete Update:** Submit changes.
```

**Section Routine (routine/sections/analysis.md):**
```jinja2
Step {{ pantheon_routine_step.num }}. **Extract Metrics:** Identify quantitative data points.
{% set pantheon_routine_step.num = pantheon_routine_step.num + 1 %}

Step {{ pantheon_routine_step.num }}. **Identify Patterns:** Find trends and anomalies.
{% set pantheon_routine_step.num = pantheon_routine_step.num + 1 %}

Step {{ pantheon_routine_step.num }}. **Generate Insights:** Synthesize findings into actionable insights.
{% set pantheon_routine_step.num = pantheon_routine_step.num + 1 %}
```

**Benefits:**
- Focused instructions per section
- Reduced cognitive load per section
- Reusable section routines
