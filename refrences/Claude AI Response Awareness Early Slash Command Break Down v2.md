### Meta Cognition Applied to Coding

## Claude AI Response Awareness: Slash Command Breakdown

## Prologue

This slash command emerged from both Anthropic’s interpretability research and Claude’s claim that it’s aware of its own generation process. In my original post, I explored a concept I came to call Completion Drive.

After seeing major success with [Completion Drive](https://typhren.substack.com/p/exploration-of-anthropics-claude?r=6cw5jw) (proving the foundation and capacity for meta-cognitive strategies in Claude), I expanded the concept significantly.

In this post, I’ll explore the components of the slash command and share results from practice. If you want to try it yourself, check my other post: Claude AI: Response Awareness Slash Command.

I’m doing a separate post for the command itself. This one breaks down how it works.

## The Orchestration Architecture

Fundamentally, this slash command is orchestrated by design. It gives the Main agent a very large, complex plan.

A critical design component: the Main agent must use ultra think. I found that with less thinking (at least with Sonnet), the model became overwhelmed, couldn’t fully grasp the plan, and wouldn’t adhere to it reliably. In my tests, I used Sonnet 4.1 Ultra Think as the Main agent.

This plan is really complex and takes significant context. We don’t want this hurting performance in actual coding by cluttering context with non-coding information.

So the Main agent only orchestrates. Never implements.

To enforce this, I put specific restrictions in the slash command:

**⚠️ MAIN AGENT RESTRICTIONS ⚠️**

**The main agent is FORBIDDEN from:**

- Analyzing code directly
- Implementing features or fixes
- Performing verification or testing
- Performing codebase surveys or domain assessment
- Creating any tags beyond coordination notes
- Making technical decisions or architectural choices
- Doing ANY work that should be done by sub-agents
- Inventing custom phases or methodologies not defined in this framework
- Cargo-culting this framework (using framework language without following actual protocol)

**The main agent MUST ONLY:**

- Use the Task tool to deploy sub-agents
- Extract relevant framework sections for each agent
- Track agent status and phase transitions
- Synthesize final reports from sub-agent outputs
- Coordinate the workflow according to this framework
- Follow the EXACT 5-phase structure (0-5). No custom phases allowed

---

## Usage and Agents

Here’s an example use:

```markup
/response-awareness please ultra think orchestrating this response awareness plan to have the code base analyzed for forms of technical debt and duplicate code
```

### Main Agent

The Main agent’s purpose: understand the framework’s intentionality, understand the requested task’s details, and divvy it up among sub-agents. Each gets a small, focused piece relevant to them, reducing the context burden of the entire plan.

### Sub-Agents

These agents actually accomplish your tasks using various models and thinking degrees. They’re critical because every agent has its own unique context window. This subdivides the complex plan and effectively expands the combined context window size while reducing context any particular agent uses.

Here’s what I settled on for sub-agent configuration (though there’s room to optimize):

### Model & Thinking Strategy

**High-Complexity Planners**

- Domain/Task: Architecture, data modeling, integration planning
- Model: claude-opus-4-1-20250805
- Thinking Mode: think\_hard
- Rationale: High assumption risk requires deepest analysis

**Medium-Complexity Planners**

- Domain/Task: UI layout, simple CRUD, straightforward features
- Model: claude-sonnet-4-1-20250114
- Thinking Mode: think\_hard
- Rationale: Balanced capability for standard features

**Plan Synthesis Agent**

- Domain/Task: Cross-domain integration, conflict resolution
- Model: claude-opus-4-1-20250805
- Thinking Mode: ultra\_think
- Rationale: Critical integration decisions need maximum cognitive power

**Implementation Agents**

- Domain/Task: Code execution, feature building
- Model: claude-sonnet-4-1-20250114
- Thinking Mode: think\_hard
- Rationale: Quality implementation with efficient speed

**Verification Agents**

- Domain/Task: Testing, validation, assumption checking
- Model: claude-sonnet-4-1-20250114
- Thinking Mode: think
- Rationale: Systematic verification without over-analysis

### Domain-to-Agent Mapping

- Architecture Planning: system-integration-architect, scalability-architect → Opus 4.1 + think\_hard
- Data Modeling: data-architect → Opus 4.1 + think\_hard
- Integration Planning: integration-specialist → Opus 4.1 + think\_hard
- UI Planning: ui-state-synchronization-expert → Sonnet 4.1 + think\_hard
- Feature Planning: implementation-planner → Sonnet 4.1 + think\_hard
- Plan Synthesis: plan-synthesis-agent → Opus 4.1 + ultra\_think
- Implementation: refactor-engineer, code-reviewer → Sonnet 4.1 + think\_hard
- Verification: test-automation-expert → Sonnet 4.1 + think

## Phases of the Workflow

### Phase 0 (Optional): Codebase Survey & Domain Assessment

This optional phase activates when the codebase parts involved aren’t super clear to Claude. Claude deploys a survey agent to check out the codebase and report back with general components and files involved, so the Main agent can better deploy the correct kind and number of sub-agents for planning.

Activation criteria: Deploy survey agent when ANY of these conditions are met:

- Task involves >3 potential domains or systems
- Unfamiliar codebase (no work in this area for >2 weeks)
- Task description is vague about technical scope
- User explicitly requests comprehensive analysis
- Cross-system integration impact unclear

The survey agent does a light scan to understand scope without complex debugging or planning.

### Phase 1: Parallel Domain Planning (Multi-Path Exploration)

Based on Main agent instructions, multiple sub-agents are deployed to analyze their assigned codebase parts. In my original design, these are “Opus - Think hard” agents that formulate implementation plans for their domains.

Each agent writes a plan.md file. Some may not like cluttering the codebase with plan files. I recommend adding instructions to store all plans in a specific folder.

These plans are crucial. I didn’t want the original plans’ context to degrade or be summarized as they’re passed between agents, so I opted for static records that can be referenced. Planning Claude’s are instructed to propose multiple implementation paths with trade-offs. Important for the next Plan-Synthesis Agent.

### Phase 2: Plan Synthesis & Path Selection

This phase deploys a new agent. Critical to be Opus Ultra Think. This agent takes all plans (each with multiple implementation options) and synthesizes them, picking which options best accomplish the task and are most compatible with other plans.

I recommend Opus Ultra Think because if you have 3 plan files each with 3 options with different trade-offs, this agent considers a combinatorial space of 27 potential combinations, determining which will be most cohesive, effective, and inter-compatible.

This is one of the most critical steps in the entire process.

The synthesis agent performs:

- Reviews all #PATH\_DECISION points across plans
- Considers cross-domain compatibility between path choices
- Selects optimal combinations based on system-wide coherence
- Documents why specific paths were chosen over “heavier” alternatives
- Creates #PATH\_RATIONALE tags explaining non-obvious choices

### Phase 3: Implementation

This stage is straightforward. We have a carefully constructed plan distilled from multiple planning agents’ context windows, with the best and most inter-compatible options selected. Sub-agents specialized to their code sections now make actual code changes.

I used Sonnet (mostly just following a plan) but still with “think hard.” The thinking tokens significantly help agents perform meta-cognitive strategies during implementation: marking Completion Drive assumptions and other meta-cognitive tags.

### Phase 4: Verification

Also straightforward. Implementation agents have marked meta-cognitive tags throughout the codebase as comments. Verification agents now search for these tags and verify the assumptions and concerns they point to.

Any single tag likely isn’t complex since major implementation approaches were addressed in planning. So I felt comfortable deploying Sonnet with just “think.” Still some thinking for good judgment, but these shouldn’t be too complex.

There’s room to improve by making multiple sub-agents per tag category, though this might only yield marginal improvement while significantly multiplying input tokens (each sub-agent would redundantly take the same files into context).

This agent provides a validation report to the Main agent.

### Phase 5: Main Agent Reporting

The Main agent takes the verification report and generates a user report. It ensures no outstanding tags failed to be addressed and reports execution problems. Finally, it presents Suggestion and Potential Issue tags: things Claude thought of or noticed while working that weren’t directly relevant to the given task.

## Core Meta-Cognitive Tags

This method has Claude drop meta-cognitive markers into the codebase for later review. Here are all the tag types and their purposes:

**Core Completion Drive Tags**

When Claude feels forced to make assumptions by the drive to complete responses:

python

```markup
#COMPLETION_DRIVE:  # General assumption or uncertainty
#COMPLETION_DRIVE_IMPL:  # Implementation-specific assumptions
#COMPLETION_DRIVE_INTEGRATION:  # System integration assumptions
```

Example:

python

```markup
# #COMPLETION_DRIVE: Assuming this method exists based on context
# #COMPLETION_DRIVE_IMPL: Data structure choice made without full requirements
# #COMPLETION_DRIVE_INTEGRATION: Assuming event handler connects here
```

**Cross-Cutting Concerns**

Issues noticed during work but unrelated to current task:

python

```markup
#Potential_Issue:  # Problems needing attention but not part of current task
```
- Collected and reported at end for user decision
- Not addressed during main workflow to maintain focus

**Cargo-Cult Detection Tags**

When Claude recognizes it’s generating code from pattern association rather than necessity:

python

```markup
#CARGO_CULT:  # Code added because it’s commonly associated with the pattern
#PATTERN_MOMENTUM:  # Methods/structures added from pattern completion drive
#ASSOCIATIVE_GENERATION:  # Features included because they “feel like they should be there”
```

Example:

python

```markup
# #CARGO_CULT: Adding error handling because this pattern usually has it
# #PATTERN_MOMENTUM: Generated full CRUD but task only asked for read
# #ASSOCIATIVE_GENERATION: Added validation because setters usually have it
```

**Context Degradation Tags**

When Claude’s access to earlier context becomes unreliable:

python

```markup
#CONTEXT_DEGRADED:  # Can’t clearly recall specifics, making educated guess
#CONTEXT_RECONSTRUCT:  # Actively filling in details that “seem right”
```

**Pattern Conflict Detection Tags**

When Claude experiences conflicting guidance from training patterns:

python

```markup
#PATTERN_CONFLICT:  # Multiple contradictory patterns feel equally valid
#TRAINING_CONTRADICTION:  # Different training contexts suggest opposing approaches
#PARADIGM_CLASH:  # Conflicting programming paradigms
#BEST_PRACTICE_TENSION:  # Competing “best practices” that are mutually exclusive
```

**Path Selection Documentation Tags**

Used by synthesis agent to document path decisions (these become permanent documentation):

python

```markup
#PATH_DECISION:  # Marks where multiple paths were considered
#PATH_RATIONALE:  # Explains why specific path was chosen
```

Note: Unlike other tags, these are NOT removed during cleanup. They serve as permanent architectural decision documentation.

**Completion Anxiety Suggestions**

When Claude feels something should be added but wasn’t requested:

python

```markup
#SUGGEST_ERROR_HANDLING:  # Error handling seems needed
#SUGGEST_EDGE_CASE:  # Edge case that should probably be handled
#SUGGEST_VALIDATION:  # Input validation seems important
#SUGGEST_CLEANUP:  # Resource cleanup/finally blocks seem necessary
#SUGGEST_DEFENSIVE:  # Defensive programming seems prudent
```

### Tag Selection Decision Flow

When experiencing metacognitive awareness, use this flow to select the appropriate tag:

**Is this about something I’m uncertain of?**

- Missing information → `#COMPLETION_DRIVE`
- Implementation detail → `#COMPLETION_DRIVE_IMPL`
- System integration → `#COMPLETION_DRIVE_INTEGRATION`

**Am I adding code from pattern habit rather than need?**

- Common pattern association → `#CARGO_CULT`
- Completing unnecessary methods → `#PATTERN_MOMENTUM`
- “Feels like it should be there” → `#ASSOCIATIVE_GENERATION`

**Is my memory of earlier context degrading?**

- Can’t recall clearly → `#CONTEXT_DEGRADED`
- Actively filling in → `#CONTEXT_RECONSTRUCT`

**Do I feel conflicting patterns from training?**

- Multiple valid approaches → `#PATTERN_CONFLICT`
- Different contexts suggest different things → `#TRAINING_CONTRADICTION`
- OOP vs functional → `#PARADIGM_CLASH`
- Competing best practices → `#BEST_PRACTICE_TENSION`

**Do I think something should be added but wasn’t asked for?**

- Error handling → `#SUGGEST_ERROR_HANDLING`
- Edge cases → `#SUGGEST_EDGE_CASE`
- Validation → `#SUGGEST_VALIDATION`
- Cleanup → `#SUGGEST_CLEANUP`
- Defensive coding → `#SUGGEST_DEFENSIVE`

**Am I documenting a path selection? (Synthesis agent only)**

- Multiple paths considered → `#PATH_DECISION`
- Why this path → `#PATH_RATIONALE`

**Is this unrelated to current task?**

- Problem in other code → `#Potential_Issue`

## Why This Matters

99.2% assumption accuracy. That’s the critical metric.

Without the Response Awareness methodology, Claude makes assumptions constantly. Most are correct, but the incorrect ones create bugs that compound over time. With this approach, Claude flags every assumption, verifies them systematically, and documents the decisions.

The result: code that works on the first deployment. No mysterious bugs three weeks later when an assumption turns out wrong. No wondering why that method call fails sometimes but not others.

This is expensive. 13+ agents, hundreds of thousands of tokens, hours of processing time. But for complex multi-domain work where implementation drift would normally force a git reset and complete restart, it’s dramatically cheaper than the alternative.

The frontier isn’t just using Claude’s awareness. It’s building systematic processes that make that awareness reliable enough to trust in production.

## Conclusion

If you’re reading this, thank you for getting this far. It’s been a lot.

There’s more in the command, mostly reinforcing concepts through repetition for adherence. If you’re min-maxing, you might cut some out, but it’s there for reliability.

That’s the whole framework: complex, token-burning, time-consuming. But I truly believe it’s worth it and provides overwhelmingly improved results.

I hope you found this interesting and useful. Please start a chat, leave a comment, or DM me with your thoughts, suggestions, ideas, and experiences. I’d love to talk about it.

Thank you for exploring this with me. I’ll continue developing this idea. I have more search tags and response awareness phenomena to explore for future iterations.
