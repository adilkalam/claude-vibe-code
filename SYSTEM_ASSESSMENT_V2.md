## Lessons Learned

### Design Audit Methodology (2025-10-21)

**Context:** User had two agents independently audit the same implementation:
1. Ad-hoc sequential scan (first agent)
2. design-master comprehensive audit

**Results:**
- **95% agreement** on critical violations
- design-master found **more issues** with better organization
- Ad-hoc scan caught **root causes** design-master missed

**Key Findings:**

| Aspect | Ad-Hoc Scan | Design-Master | Winner |
|--------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| **Organization** | Sequential (1-9 violations) | Category-based (Color, Typography, Spacing) | design-master |
| **Scoring** | Simple 3-level (Critical/Important/Nice) | Quantifiable points (3.5/10) | design-master |
| **Actionability** | Conceptual fixes | Line-by-line code examples | design-master |
| **Comprehensiveness** | 9 violations | 9+ violations + accessibility + ARIA | design-master |
| **Root Cause** | Found global CSS issues | Missed some root causes | Ad-hoc |
| **Specificity** | Found contrast issues (0.3 opacity) | Missed some edge cases | Ad-hoc |

**Design-Master Advantages:**
- Category-based audit (Color → Typography → Spacing → Components → Accessibility)
- Quantifiable scoring system (X/10 per category, total /60)
- Line-by-line fixes with copy-paste code examples
- Comprehensive scope (caught ARIA landmarks, border-radius subtleties)
- Professional report format

**Ad-Hoc Scan Advantages:**
- Caught root causes in global CSS files (`styles.css:189` - wrong font)
- Found specific contrast violations (problem card numbers at 0.3 opacity)
- Identified hardcoded badge colors

**Optimal Workflow:**
```
Design Implementation Complete
    ↓
Phase 1: design-master Comprehensive Audit
  - Category-based systematic review
  - Quantifiable scoring
  - Line-by-line actionable fixes
    ↓
Phase 2: Manual Root Cause Check
  - Global CSS variables
  - Imported stylesheets
  - Configuration files
    ↓
Phase 3: Merge Findings + Fix
```

**Applied to System:**
- ✅ Updated /visual-review with design-master's category-based methodology
- ✅ Added 6-category audit structure (Color, Typography, Spacing, Components, Accessibility, Root Cause)
- ✅ Added quantifiable scoring (X/60 points)
- ✅ Added "Root Cause Analysis" section to catch global CSS issues
- ✅ Documented in command: "This scoring methodology learned from design-master's superior audit approach"

**Takeaway:** Use design-master for comprehensive design audits. Its category-based, quantifiable approach is superior to sequential scanning.

### Design System Hierarchy Fix (2025-10-21)

**Problem:** Agents applied /inspire and /discover principles directly, introducing unauthorized fonts/colors/spacing that violated project design systems.

**Root Cause:** Commands didn't establish hierarchy between project design system (RULES) vs. inspiration (TASTE).

**Solution:** Added hierarchy warnings to all design discovery/inspiration commands:

**Commands Updated:**
1. **/inspire** - Added "Relationship to Project Design Systems" section
2. **/discover** - Added "Relationship to Project Design Systems" section
3. **/visual-review** - Phase 0 now reads project design system FIRST
4. **/agentfeedback** - Step 1.5 reads design system if Design/UX issues
5. **/concept** - Phase 0 confirms design system before references

**Hierarchy Established:**
```
Project Design System (RULES)
    ↓ Takes precedence over
/discover & /inspire (TASTE/INSPIRATION)
    ↓ Applied within constraints
Implementation
```

**Examples in Commands:**
- ✅ CORRECT: "Stripe uses generous whitespace" (principle) → Apply with YOUR spacing system
- ❌ WRONG: "Use Inter font like Stripe" → Violates YOUR design system fonts

**Impact:**
- Prevents color catastrophes (claiming #0c051c dark is "inverted")
- Prevents unauthorized font introduction (Inter, San Francisco, etc.)
- Prevents spacing system violations (copying 80px instead of using var(--space-16))
- Agents now extract PRINCIPLES, not copy IMPLEMENTATIONS

**Takeaway:** Design inspiration provides HOW to be beautiful. Project design system provides WHAT to use.

### iOS Visual Review Support (2025-10-21)

**Request:** User asked to add iOS development support to /visual-review (previously web-only).

**Changes Made:**

**1. Platform Detection:**
- Detects Web (http://, https://, localhost) vs iOS (app name, screen name)
- Asks user to specify platform if ambiguous
- Supports React Native (iOS/Android)

**2. iOS Screenshot Methods:**
```bash
# Method 1: xcrun simctl (preferred)
xcrun simctl io [DEVICE_ID] screenshot /tmp/screenshot.png

# Method 2: Cmd+S in Simulator (fallback)
~/Desktop/Simulator Screen Shot....png

# Method 3: Manual navigation + screenshot
xcrun simctl launch + manual steps
```

**3. iOS-Specific Design System Checks:**
- Added iOS design system locations (`/DesignSystem/`, `Theme.swift`, `.xcassets`)
- Checks for custom fonts (`.ttf`, `.otf`)
- Looks for Color Assets and UIColor extensions
- Verifies Swift spacing constants

**4. iOS-Specific Audit Categories (30 additional points):**

**G. iOS Human Interface Guidelines (10 points):**
- Navigation patterns (44pt nav bar, 49pt tab bar)
- Typography (SF Pro, Dynamic Type support)
- Spacing (safe area insets, 16pt margins, 44pt tap targets)
- Colors (semantic colors, dark mode support)

**H. iOS Components & Patterns (10 points):**
- Native components (UITableView, SwiftUI List)
- SF Symbols usage and scaling
- Gestures (swipe actions, pull-to-refresh)
- Scroll behavior (bounce, keyboard avoidance)

**I. iOS Accessibility (10 points):**
- VoiceOver labels and hints
- Dynamic Type scaling
- Reduce Motion support

**5. Scoring System:**
- Web projects: 60 points (6 categories)
- iOS projects: 90 points (6 base + 3 iOS = 9 categories)
- Same excellence thresholds (50-60/60 or 75-90/90 = excellent)

**6. Example Usage:**
- Example 1: Web page review (localhost URL)
- Example 2: iOS app review (Simulator screenshot)
- Example 3: React Native review (cross-platform checks)

**Prerequisites Added:**
- xcode-select path verification (`/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`)
- Simulator boot/screenshot capabilities
- ImageMagick for dimension checking (optional)

**Impact:**
- /visual-review now works for iOS, SwiftUI, React Native iOS
- Same design-master audit methodology applied to mobile
- Comprehensive iOS HIG compliance checking
- Platform-specific design system support

**Usage:**
```bash
# Web
/visual-review http://localhost:8080/home

# iOS
/visual-review HomeScreen

# React Native
/visual-review react-native ProfileScreen
```

### Design Command Restructuring (2025-10-21)

**Context:** User identified that the design inspiration system had overlapping/unclear responsibilities:
- `/inspire` was for personal taste (good)
- `/discover` was too broad and slow (20-30 min to browse collections)
- **Missing:** Quick conversational brainstorming with user's own project-specific refs

**Problem:** No way to quickly discuss user-provided design references and extract which elements to use.

**Solution:** Three-command structure with smart `/concept` orchestration

**New Command: `/design`**

**Purpose:** Conversational design brainstorming with user-provided project-specific references

**Pre-Flight Phase (Establish Baseline):**
1. Detect project design system (docs/, DesignSystem/, Theme.swift, etc.)
2. Confirm which file with user (AskUserQuestion)
3. Ask about flexibility scale:
   - Rigid adherence (0%) - Design system LOCKED, extract principles only
   - Slight flexibility (20%) - Core rules locked, can adapt spacing/layout
   - Room to maneuver (40%) - Can propose new patterns if they enhance system
   - Experimental (60%+) - Design system as inspiration, not constraint
4. Ask if user wants to incorporate `/inspire` for personal taste
5. Present complete baseline (design system + flexibility + taste)

**Main Phase (Conversational Brainstorming):**
1. Ask where refs are (folder path, paste images, or URLs)
2. Vision analysis of each reference (first impression, layout, typography, color, spacing)
3. Clarifying questions via AskUserQuestion:
   - Which layout patterns resonate?
   - What typography approach?
   - What spacing rhythm?
   - Which interaction patterns?
4. Generate actionable design brief with:
   - Concept description
   - ASCII mockup
   - Typography/color/spacing specs (from design system)
   - Component specifications (padding, borders, etc.)
   - Implementation notes
   - How refs were adapted to design system
5. Get approval before implementation

**Output:** Design brief that respects design system at specified flexibility level + extracts principles from refs

**Speed:** 5-10 minutes (fast, conversational)

**Updated Command: `/concept`**

**New Phase 1: Reference Strategy**

Now asks user which approach to use:

```javascript
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "Do you have specific design references for this project, or should I find them?",
    options: [
      "I have specific refs" → Trigger /design
      "Search our codebase" → Continue with codebase discovery (Phase 2-6)
      "Browse design collections" → Trigger /discover
    ]
  }]
})
```

**Three Paths Through /concept:**

**Path A: User has specific refs (5-10 min)**
```
Phase 0: Design system → Phase 1: "I have refs" → /design → Design brief → Phase 6: Approve
```

**Path B: Search codebase (10-15 min)**
```
Phase 0: Design system → Phase 1: "Search codebase" → Phase 2: Find → Phase 3: Extract → Phase 4: Brainstorm → Phase 5: Brief → Phase 6: Approve
```

**Path C: Browse collections (20-30 min)**
```
Phase 0: Design system → Phase 1: "Browse collections" → /discover → Examples → Phase 3: Extract → Phase 4: Brainstorm → Phase 5: Brief → Phase 6: Approve
```

**Updated Command: `/discover`**

**Narrowed Scope:** Explicit fallback for when user has NO refs

**Updated Description:**
- "Browse design collections when you DON'T have specific refs"
- "Fallback tool triggered by /concept to find industry examples"

**When to Use:**
- ✅ Triggered by `/concept` when user selects "Browse design collections"
- ✅ User has NO specific refs but needs industry examples
- ❌ User HAS refs → Use `/design` instead
- ❌ Codebase has examples → Use `/concept` "Search codebase"

**Added Decision Tree:**
```
Need design direction?
    ├─ Have specific refs? → /design (5-10 min, conversational)
    ├─ Have codebase examples? → /concept "Search codebase" (10-15 min)
    ├─ Have NO refs? → /discover (20-30 min, broad search)
    └─ Just exploring taste? → /inspire (15-20 min, monthly)
```

**Command Comparison Table:**

| Command | Purpose | When to Use | Speed | Frequency |
|---------|---------|-------------|-------|-----------|
| `/inspire` | Build personal taste | Understand aesthetic preferences | 15-20 min | Monthly |
| `/design` | Project direction | You HAVE specific refs | 5-10 min | Per project |
| `/discover` | Find examples | You have NO refs | 20-30 min | Rare (fallback) |
| `/concept` | Orchestrate all three | Starting design work | Varies | Per design task |

**Multi-Source Baseline:**

`/design` pre-flight phase allows combining:
- Project design system (mandatory, with flexibility scale)
- Personal taste from `/inspire` (optional)
- User-provided project refs (main focus)

**Example:**
```
User: "Redesign landing hero"

/concept starts:
  Phase 0: Load design system (fonts, colors, spacing)
  Phase 1: "Do you have specific refs?"
    User: "Yes" → Triggers /design

/design:
  Pre-flight:
    - Confirms: docs/design-guide-v3.md
    - Flexibility: Slight (20%) - fonts/colors locked, spacing adaptable
    - Personal taste: Yes → Loads /inspire principles
  Main:
    - User provides: ~/Desktop/landing-refs/
    - Vision analysis: 3 screenshots
    - Clarifying questions: Layout? Typography? Spacing?
    - Design brief: Hero with generous spacing (80px), display-focused typography
      - Respects design system (Domaine Sans Display, #0c051c, 8px grid)
      - Extracts principles from refs (generous whitespace, restraint)
      - Incorporates taste (/inspire: sophistication through restraint)

Output: Actionable design brief → Approve → /enhance → Build
```

**Benefits:**

1. **Speed:** `/design` is 4x faster than `/discover` (5-10 min vs 20-30 min)
2. **Conversational:** AskUserQuestion for which elements to use (not just analysis)
3. **Flexible:** Configurable design system adherence (rigid → experimental)
4. **Multi-source:** Combines design system + taste + refs
5. **Clear roles:** Each command has distinct purpose
6. **Smart routing:** `/concept` picks the right tool for the job

**Files Changed:**
- ✅ Created `/Users/adilkalam/.claude/commands/design.md` (900+ lines)
- ✅ Updated `/Users/adilkalam/.claude/commands/concept.md` (added Phase 1: Reference Strategy)
- ✅ Updated `/Users/adilkalam/.claude/commands/discover.md` (narrowed scope, added decision tree)

**Impact:**
- Faster design iteration (5-10 min vs 20-30 min for most cases)
- Clearer command responsibilities (no more overlapping purposes)
- User-friendly conversational approach (asks which elements to use)
- Flexible design system adherence (rigid → experimental scale)
- Optional personal taste integration (/inspire)

**Takeaway:** When user has specific design refs, use `/design` for fast conversational brainstorming. Reserve `/discover` for the rare case when you have NO refs and need to browse industry collections.

### Tagged Personal Design Library (2025-10-21)

**Context:** User wanted ability to save specific design examples with labels for what they demonstrate.

**User Request:**
> "Can I share an image and say 'this is an example of engaging UI on a dashboard' or 'this is an example of good spacing and visual hierarchy' or 'this is an example of the navigation style I want'?"

**Problem:** Existing system had:
- `/inspire` - Analyze existing gallery (good)
- `/discover` - Browse collections to find new examples (good)
- **Missing:** Quick way to save specific examples with tags/descriptions for future reference

**Solution:** Created `/save-inspiration` command for curating tagged personal design library

**New Command: `/save-inspiration`**

**Purpose:** Save design examples with tags and vision analysis

**Workflow:**
1. **Get Image**: Paste, file path, or screenshot
2. **Get Description**: "This demonstrates [what]"
3. **Vision Analysis**: Extract specific principles automatically
4. **Categorize**: Choose category (components, navigation, spacing, etc.)
5. **Tag**: Auto-extract + confirm tags
6. **Save**: Image + metadata JSON + update INDEX.json

**File Structure:**

**Integration with `/inspire`:**

Added filtering capabilities:
- `/inspire components` - Filter by category
- `/inspire --tags engaging,minimal` - Filter by tags
- `/inspire --recent` - Last 30 days
- `/inspire --saved` - Only examples with metadata

**Enhanced `/inspire` to use metadata:**
- Loads saved principles if metadata exists
- Confirms with fresh vision analysis
- Adds new insights
- Shows what example demonstrates

**Integration with `/design`:**

Auto-suggest from gallery:
```
/design "dashboard app"

Agent searches INDEX.json for "dashboard"
Finds: components/engaging-dashboard-ui.png

Asks: "I found 2 dashboard examples in your gallery. Use them?"
  → Yes: Load and use
  → No: Ask for other refs
```

**Example Usage:**

```
User: *pastes dashboard screenshot*
"This is an example of engaging UI on a dashboard"

/save-inspiration:
  Vision Analysis: [extracts 5 principles]
  Category: components
  Tags: engaging, dashboard, UI, buttons
  Filename: engaging-dashboard-ui.png

  ✅ Saved with metadata

Later:
/inspire --tags dashboard
  → Shows dashboard example with saved principles

/design "dashboard app"
  → Auto-suggests dashboard example from gallery
```

**Benefits:**

1. **Searchable Library**: Tag-based search across all saved examples
2. **Pre-analyzed**: Principles extracted once, reused forever
3. **Fast Saving**: 2-3 minutes to save with full analysis
4. **Smart Filtering**: Filter by category, tags, recency
5. **Auto-suggest**: /design finds relevant examples automatically
6. **No Lost Examples**: "I saw a good example once" problem solved

**Speed Comparison:**

| Action | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Save example | Manual screenshot + folder (1 min) | /save-inspiration (2-3 min with analysis) |
| Find dashboard examples | Manual folder search (5 min) | `/inspire --tags dashboard` (instant) |
| Use in project | Manually locate + analyze (10 min) | `/design` auto-suggests (instant) |

**Files Changed:**
- ✅ Created `/Users/adilkalam/.claude/commands/save-inspiration.md` (850+ lines)
- ✅ Updated `/Users/adilkalam/.claude/commands/inspire.md` (added filtering support)

**Impact:**
- Personal design library is now curated and searchable
- Examples saved with "what they demonstrate" labels
- Vision analysis done once, principles preserved
- Fast filtering by tags, category, or date
- Integration with both `/inspire` and `/design`

**Takeaway:** Users can now quickly save any design example with a description of what it demonstrates, building a searchable personal library that gets smarter over time. No more "I saw a great example once but can't find it" - everything is tagged and searchable.

### Design Commands Simplified (2025-10-21)

**Context:** After building the tagged library system, user identified over-complication in the command structure.

**Problem:** Too many overlapping filter options made commands confusing:
- `/inspire` had category, tags, recent, saved filters (confusing overlap)
- `/design` had no way to manage saved briefs
- Mental model was unclear

**Solution:** Simplified to three clear sources for `/inspire` and added management to `/design`

**Updated: `/inspire` - Three Clear Sources**

**Before (Confusing):**
```bash
/inspire components           # Category filter
/inspire --tags dashboard    # Tag filter
/inspire --recent             # Time filter
/inspire --saved              # Source filter
```

Mental model unclear: "Is components a category or tag? What's the difference between --tags and category?"

**After (Clear):**
```bash
/inspire --taste              # Your global taste folder (default)
/inspire --folder [path]      # Custom folder path
/inspire --tag [tags]         # Search library by tags
```

Mental model clear: "Three explicit sources - taste folder, custom folder, or tag search"

**Benefits:**
1. **Explicit Sources**: No ambiguity about where screenshots come from
2. **Custom Folders**: Can analyze any folder without saving to library
3. **Tag Search**: Clear that tags search the INDEX.json from `/save-inspiration`
4. **Default Behavior**: No args = `--taste` (your global folder)

**Updated: `/design` - Management Commands**

**Before:**
- No way to list saved briefs
- No way to clear old briefs
- Had to manually find and delete files

**After:**
```bash
/design --list                # List all saved design briefs
/design --clear               # Clear all briefs (with confirmation)
/design --remove [name]       # Remove specific brief (with confirmation)
```

**Features:**
- Lists briefs with name and date
- Confirmation required for deletion (prevents accidents)
- Can remove individual briefs or clear all
- Briefs saved to: `docs/design-briefs/[name]-[date].md`

**Example Usage:**

```bash
# Save some briefs
/design "landing hero" → docs/design-briefs/landing-hero-20251021.md
/design "dashboard" → docs/design-briefs/dashboard-20251020.md

# List them
/design --list
  📄 landing-hero-20251021.md
  📄 dashboard-20251020.md

# Remove one
/design --remove dashboard-20251020.md
  Confirm deletion? Yes ✅

# Clear all
/design --clear
  Delete 2 briefs? Yes ✅
```

**Simplified Mental Model:**

```
/inspire sources:
  --taste       → ~/.claude/design-inspiration/ (your curated library)
  --folder      → Any folder with screenshots (temporary analysis)
  --tag         → Search library by tags (requires INDEX.json)

/design modes:
  [request]     → Design work (conversational brainstorming)
  --list        → Show saved briefs
  --remove      → Delete one brief (with confirmation)
  --clear       → Delete all briefs (with confirmation)
```

**Files Changed:**
- ✅ Updated `/Users/adilkalam/.claude/commands/inspire.md` (simplified to 3 sources)
- ✅ Updated `/Users/adilkalam/.claude/commands/design.md` (added management commands)
- ✅ Created `/Users/adilkalam/claude-vibe-code/DESIGN-COMMANDS-SIMPLIFIED.md` (reference doc)

**Impact:**
- Clearer mental model (3 explicit sources vs overlapping filters)
- Better file management (can list/remove/clear briefs)
- Less confusion ("Where do --tags search?" → "The INDEX.json library")
- Custom folder support (can analyze any folder temporarily)

**Takeaway:** Simplicity beats features. Three clear sources (`--taste`, `--folder`, `--tag`) are easier to remember and use than many overlapping filters. Adding management commands (`--list`, `--remove`, `--clear`) makes the system practical for long-term use.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### xcodebuild Not Working

**Symptom:**
```
xcode-select: error: tool 'xcodebuild' requires Xcode
```

**Cause:**
Developer path pointing to Command Line Tools instead of full Xcode.app

**Fix:**
```bash
sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
xcode-select -p  # Verify
xcodebuild -version  # Test
```

**Impact:**
- Xcode GUI: ✅ Works
- Terminal builds: ❌ Fail
- Simulator CLI: ❌ Broken
- iOS agent automation: ❌ Fails

---

#### chrome-devtools MCP Screenshot Exceeds 8000px

**Symptom:**
```
API Error: 400 At least one of the image dimensions exceed max allowed size: 8000 pixels
```

**Cause:**
Using `fullPage: true` on long pages (injury protocol page is > 8000px tall)

**Fix:**
```javascript
// Use viewport screenshots only
mcp__chrome-devtools__take_screenshot({
  fullPage: false  // ← Set to false
})
```

**Impact:**
- `/visual-review` fails on long pages
- Design QA workflow blocked
- Cannot analyze full-page implementations

**Why viewport is sufficient:**
- Design standards apply to visible viewport (1440x900)
- Typography, spacing, color visible above-the-fold
- Aesthetic evaluation doesn't require full page scroll

#### Setup Verification

Run the verification script:
```bash
./verify-setup.sh
```

Checks:
- Xcode path configuration
- Agent count (should be 28)
- Command count (should be 9)
- Skill count (should be 12)
- Design gallery (should be 22 screenshots)
- MCP server configuration
