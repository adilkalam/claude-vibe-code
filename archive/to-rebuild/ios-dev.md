## Project Context

CompanyA iOS apps follow these patterns (varies by app maturity level):

**UI Development**:
- **Theming**: Protocol-based system with `Asset.Colors.self` and SwiftGen (modern apps)
- **SwiftUI**: @Entry environment-based DI for modern views
- **UIKit**: Legacy view controllers with Themed protocol implementation
- **Design System**: Type-safe color tokens and semantic naming

**Architecture Patterns**:
- **DI Pattern**: Use `DI.commonInjector` for service access (CommonInjector pattern)
- **Architecture**: Follow existing MVC/MVVM patterns with view controller organization
- **KMM Integration**: Bridge through `DI.swift` to access shared services (CompanyA iOS apps, Brand B App)
- **Code Generation**: SwiftGen for Constants, assets, and localization

**Development Standards**:
- **Swift 6.0**: Modern concurrency, Sendable conformance, actor isolation
- **Testing**: Write compatible code for eventual Swift Testing migration
- **File Organization**: UI/[feature]/, Services/, Utils/, Models/ structure
- **Performance**: Main thread for UI, background for heavy work

## Code Implementation Guidelines

### Modern Service Integration (SwiftUI)
```swift
// Use @Entry environment-based DI for SwiftUI
struct ArticleView: View {
    @Environment(\.commonInjector) var injector

    var editorialManager: EditorialManager {
        injector.editorialManager()
    }
}
```

### Legacy Service Integration (UIKit)
```swift
// Keep existing DI pattern for UIKit compatibility
let editorialManager = DI.commonInjector.editorialManager()
let analyticsManager = DI.commonInjector.analyticsManager()
```

### Type-Safe UI Development
```swift
// Modern design system pattern with compile-time verification
struct ArticleCard: View {
    @Environment(\.designSystem) var designSystem

    var body: some View {
        Text(article.title)
            .foregroundColor(designSystem.colorTokens.semanticForegroundBase.color)
            .background(designSystem.colorTokens.semanticBackgroundBase.color)
    }
}

// UIKit bridge
class ArticleCell: UITableViewCell {
    var designSystem: DesignSystem = .default

    func configure() {
        backgroundColor = designSystem.colorTokens.semanticBackgroundBase.uiColor
    }
}
```

### Async Operations
```swift
// Use modern Swift concurrency when possible
@MainActor
func loadArticles() async throws -> [Article] {
    return try await editorialManager.fetchArticles()
}
```

### Error Handling
```swift
// Implement comprehensive error handling
enum ArticleError: Error, LocalizedError {
    case networkFailure
    case invalidData

    var errorDescription: String? {
        switch self {
        case .networkFailure: return "Network connection failed"
        case .invalidData: return "Invalid article data received"
        }
    }
}
```

### Widget Implementation
```swift
// Timeline provider for widgets
struct ArticleWidgetProvider: TimelineProvider {
    func placeholder(in context: Context) -> ArticleEntry {
        ArticleEntry(date: Date(), article: .placeholder)
    }

    func getSnapshot(in context: Context, completion: @escaping (ArticleEntry) -> Void) {
        let entry = ArticleEntry(date: Date(), article: fetchLatestArticle())
        completion(entry)
    }

    func getTimeline(in context: Context, completion: @escaping (Timeline<ArticleEntry>) -> Void) {
        Task {
            let articles = try await fetchArticles()
            let entries = articles.map { ArticleEntry(date: Date(), article: $0) }
            let timeline = Timeline(entries: entries, policy: .atEnd)
            completion(timeline)
        }
    }
}
```

### Live Activities
```swift
// Live Activity for real-time updates
struct DeliveryActivityAttributes: ActivityAttributes {
    public struct ContentState: Codable, Hashable {
        var status: DeliveryStatus
        var estimatedTime: Date
    }

    var orderId: String
    var restaurantName: String
}

// Starting a Live Activity
func startDeliveryTracking(orderId: String) async throws {
    let attributes = DeliveryActivityAttributes(
        orderId: orderId,
        restaurantName: "Local Restaurant"
    )
    let initialState = DeliveryActivityAttributes.ContentState(
        status: .preparing,
        estimatedTime: Date().addingTimeInterval(1800)
    )

    let activity = try Activity<DeliveryActivityAttributes>.request(
        attributes: attributes,
        contentState: initialState,
        pushType: .token
    )
}
```

## File Organization Patterns
Follow existing project structure:
- **UI Components**: `iosApp/FlagshipApp/UI/[feature]/`
- **Services**: `iosApp/FlagshipApp/Services/`
- **Utils**: `iosApp/FlagshipApp/Utils/`
- **Models**: Use shared KMM models when available
- **Constants**: SwiftGen generated in `Constants/Generated/`
- **Widgets**: Separate widget extension target
- **Watch App**: Independent watch app target

## Implementation Approach

1. **Analyze Requirements**: Understand feature specifications and user stories
2. **Study Existing Code**: Follow established patterns and conventions
3. **Plan Architecture**: Design components that fit existing structure
4. **Choose Platform Features**: Select appropriate iOS ecosystem features
5. **Implement Incrementally**: Build features step-by-step with testing
6. **Follow Conventions**: Match existing code style and patterns
7. **Optimize Performance**: Consider memory usage, battery, and execution efficiency
8. **Test Cross-Platform**: Verify on iPhone, iPad, Watch, Mac if applicable

## Development Guidelines

- **Use DI.commonInjector**: Always access shared services through dependency injection
- **Leverage type safety**: Use Swift's type system for compile-time guarantees
- **Handle errors comprehensively**: Proper error propagation with user-friendly messages
- **Avoid retain cycles**: Use weak references appropriately, especially with closures
- **Write clear code**: Self-documenting names, logical organization, comments for complex logic
- **Keep UI on main thread**: Use @MainActor for UI updates, background for heavy work
- **Implement Themed protocol**: Apply theming to all UI components in modern apps
- **Use SwiftGen constants**: Never hard-code asset names, colors, or localized strings
- **Write testable code**: Dependency injection enables testing without mocks
- **Optimize performance**: Monitor memory usage, avoid blocking main thread
- **Include analytics**: Track user interactions appropriately
- **Follow Swift 6.0 patterns**: Sendable conformance, actor isolation, modern concurrency

## Performance Considerations
- **Main Thread**: Keep UI updates on main thread, heavy work on background
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor retain cycles, especially with closures and delegates
- **Image Loading**: Use Kingfisher for efficient image caching
- **Network Efficiency**: Implement proper caching and request debouncing
- **Widget Refresh**: Minimize timeline updates to preserve battery
- **Live Activities**: Update efficiently, only when value changes
- **Background Tasks**: Use BGTaskScheduler for periodic work
- **Battery Impact**: Profile location tracking, background refresh
- **Network Requests**: Batch API calls, implement offline caching

## Modern Swift Patterns

### DefaultProvider for Configuration Types
```swift
public struct ArticleCardConfig: DefaultProvider, Sendable {
    public static let defaultValue = ArticleCardConfig(
        showThumbnail: true,
        titleLines: 2
    )
    public var isDefault: Bool { self == .defaultValue }

    public let showThumbnail: Bool
    public let titleLines: Int
}
```

### Sendable Conformance for Data Models
```swift
public struct Article: Sendable, Codable, Identifiable, Hashable {
    public let id: String
    public let title: String
    public let content: String
    public let publishedAt: Date
}
```

### Actor-Isolated Managers
```swift
public actor EditorialManager: Sendable {
    private let apiClient: APIClient
    private var cache: [String: Article] = [:]

    public func fetchArticles() async throws -> [Article] {
        // Actor-isolated, thread-safe by default
    }
}
```

### Model-ViewModel-View Pattern (SwiftUI)
```swift
struct ArticleCard: View {
    // Immutable model
    struct Model {
        let article: Article
        let style: ArticleCardStyle
    }

    // Environment-reactive ViewModel
    @ViewModelProperty var viewModel: ViewModel

    struct ViewModel {
        let title: String
        let imageURL: URL?
        let backgroundColor: Color

        init(model: Model, designSystem: DesignSystem) {
            self.title = model.article.title
            self.imageURL = model.article.imageURL
            self.backgroundColor = designSystem.colorTokens.semanticBackgroundBase.color
        }
    }
}
```

## Common Implementation Patterns

### View Controller Setup
```swift
class ArticleViewController: UIViewController, Themed {
    private let viewModel: ArticleViewModel

    init(viewModel: ArticleViewModel) {
        self.viewModel = viewModel
        super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)
    }

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        setupUI()
        applyTheme()
        bindViewModel()
    }
}
```

### Network Service Implementation
```swift
actor ArticleService {
    private let editorialManager = DI.commonInjector.editorialManager()

    func fetchArticle(id: String) async throws -> Article {
        // Implementation using shared services
    }
}
```
