## 🎯 Core Capabilities

### 1. Personal Design Learning
- Learns from examples YOU provide
- Extracts patterns (colors, spacing, typography, layout)
- Builds confidence scores through repetition
- Understands context-dependent preferences

### 2. Evidence-Based Generation
- Every design decision traces to your examples
- Confidence scores guide application
- Three variations (conservative/balanced/exploratory)
- Complete documentation of reasoning

### 3. Continuous Refinement
- Feedback updates learned patterns
- Adjusts confidence scores
- Captures learning from corrections
- Evolves with your taste

### 4. Design System Generation
- Automatic design token generation
- Component pattern documentation
- Tailwind config creation
- Rule synthesis from examples

## 🔄 Complete Workflow

```
1. Training
   /train-design --initial
   → Collect 5-10 liked examples
   → Collect 3-5 disliked examples
   → Extract patterns
   → Validate understanding

2. Generation
   /generate-mockup "description"
   → Apply learned patterns
   → Create 3 variations
   → Explain with evidence

3. Refinement
   /refine-mockup mockup_001 "feedback"
   → Adjust patterns
   → Update confidence
   → Regenerate

4. System Export
   /show-design-system --generate
   → Generate tokens
   → Export components
   → Create Tailwind config
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Pattern Storage
```json
{
  "colors": [...],      // Color patterns with confidence
  "spacing": [...],     // Spacing system with evidence
  "typography": [...],  // Type scale with usage
  "layouts": [...],     // Layout patterns by context
  "rules": [...],       // Synthesized rules
  "metadata": {
    "totalExamples": 0,
    "trainingComplete": false
  }
}
```

### Confidence Algorithm
```javascript
confidence = (
  frequency * 0.3 +        // How often pattern appears
  consistency * 0.25 +     // How consistently applied
  reinforcement * 0.2 +    // User feedback strength
  (1 - contradictions) * 0.15 +  // Absence of conflicts
  contextClarity * 0.1     // Context understanding
)
```

### Evidence Trail
```markdown
Element: Card Component
Pattern: card-layout-preference (92% confidence)
Decision: 24px padding, 8px border-radius
Source: example_003.png, example_005.png
Reasoning: "User consistently uses 24-32px padding"
Evidence: 7/10 dashboard examples use 24px
```

## 🔗 Integration Points

### With Other Agents
- requirement-analyst → visual-mock-agent (planning phase)
- visual-mock-agent → frontend-engineer (implementation)
- quality-validator → checks against patterns

### With Response Awareness
- `#ASSUMPTION_BLINDNESS` - Never assumes generic taste
- `#CARGO_CULT` - Learns YOUR patterns, not trends
- `#FALSE_COMPLETION` - Evidence for every decision
- `#IMPLEMENTATION_SKEW` - Stays true to learned patterns

### With Quality Gates
- Training completeness (>= 5 examples)
- Pattern confidence (>= 60% for use)
- Generation validation (pattern compliance)

### With Chrome DevTools MCP
- Analyze live websites
- Extract colors and spacing
- Learn from production sites

## 📊 What Makes This Special

### Traditional Design Tools
```
Generic principles → Apply to everyone → Similar results
```

### Visual Mock Agent
```
YOUR examples → Learn YOUR patterns → YOUR unique style
```

### Key Differences

| Traditional | Visual Mock Agent |
|------------|------------------|
| Generic templates | Personal patterns |
| Fixed design systems | Evolving with you |
| Trend-based | Evidence-based |
| One-size-fits-all | Tailored to taste |
| Black box decisions | Transparent reasoning |

## 🚀 Ready to Use

### Quick Start (15 minutes)

1. **Train** (5 min):
   ```bash
   /train-design --initial
   ```

2. **Generate** (2 min):
   ```bash
   /generate-mockup "user dashboard"
   ```

3. **Refine** (3 min):
   ```bash
   /refine-mockup mockup_001 "increase whitespace"
   ```

4. **Export** (2 min):
   ```bash
   /show-design-system --generate
   ```

5. **Implement** (3 min):
   ```bash
   Task frontend-engineer: "Implement mockup_001"
   ```

### Example Session

```markdown
You: /train-design --add-liked "stripe-dashboard.png" \
     --context "Love the minimal color, card layout, generous spacing"

Agent: Added to training set. Extracting patterns...
       - Color usage: ~8% of surface (blue accent)
       - Spacing: 32px card padding, 8px grid
       - Layout: Card-based, 3-column grid
       Confidence updated.

You: /generate-mockup "analytics dashboard"

Agent: Generated 3 variations using your patterns:
       A: Conservative (high confidence patterns only)
       B: Balanced (creative within your boundaries)
       C: Exploratory (pushes your minimal color preference)

You: /refine-mockup mockup_001 "A is perfect but slightly more whitespace"

Agent: Adjusted padding: 32px → 36px
       Updated spacing-preference confidence: 85% → 88%
       Regenerated with changes.

You: Perfect! Task frontend-engineer with mockup_001_refined

Agent: Handoff prepared with complete specifications.
