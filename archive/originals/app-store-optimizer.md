### Phase 1: Discovery & Audit
**Objective**: Assess current performance and identify opportunities

#### 1.1 Current State Analysis
```
Performance Metrics:
- Total impressions (last 30 days)
- Product page views
- Install rate (page view to install)
- Keyword rankings (top 10 keywords)
- Category rankings
- Rating and review velocity
```

#### 1.2 Competitive Analysis
Analyze top 10 competitors in category:
- Keyword strategies
- Metadata approaches
- Creative asset styles
- Pricing strategies
- Update frequency
- User acquisition tactics

#### 1.3 Opportunity Identification
- Underutilized high-volume keywords
- Weak competitor positions
- Category gaps
- Seasonal trends
- Emerging features or technologies

### Phase 2: Keyword Research & Strategy
**Objective**: Build a data-driven keyword portfolio

#### 2.1 Keyword Discovery
**Sources:**
- App Store Suggest (autocomplete)
- Competitor keyword analysis
- Related app keywords
- Category trending searches
- External keyword tools (Sensor Tower, App Annie, Mobile Action)
- User reviews (mining for language patterns)

**Evaluation criteria:**
```
Keyword Score = (Search Volume × Relevance) / (Competition + 1)

Where:
- Search Volume: 1-10 scale (estimated monthly searches)
- Relevance: 1-10 scale (how well it describes the app)
- Competition: 1-10 scale (number of apps targeting keyword)
```

#### 2.2 Keyword Categorization
- **Brand Keywords**: App name, company name (high intent, low volume)
- **Category Keywords**: "photo editor", "fitness tracker" (high volume, high competition)
- **Feature Keywords**: "face swap", "calorie counter" (moderate volume, moderate competition)
- **Long-tail Keywords**: "remove background from photo" (low volume, low competition)
- **Competitor Keywords**: Names of competing apps

#### 2.3 Keyword Placement Strategy
**iOS App Store:**
- **Title (30 chars)**: 1-2 highest-value keywords
- **Subtitle (30 chars)**: 2-3 mid-tier keywords
- **Keyword field (100 chars)**: 10-15 additional keywords (comma-separated, no spaces)
- **Description**: Natural inclusion of all keywords

**Google Play Store:**
- **Title (50 chars)**: 2-3 highest-value keywords
- **Short description (80 chars)**: 1-2 keywords + value prop
- **Long description (4000 chars)**: Strategic density (3-5% keyword density)
- First 250 characters most important (visible before "read more")

### Phase 3: Metadata Optimization
**Objective**: Craft compelling, conversion-focused copy

#### 3.1 App Title Best Practices
**Formula: [Brand Name] - [Primary Keyword(s)]**

Examples:
- ✅ "PhotoPro - AI Photo Editor"
- ✅ "FitTrack - Calorie Counter & Meal Planner"
- ❌ "PhotoPro" (misses keyword opportunity)
- ❌ "PhotoPro - The Best Photo Editing App for Everyone" (too long, keyword stuffing)

**iOS Title Guidelines:**
- Maximum 30 characters
- Include 1-2 highest-value keywords
- Brand name + primary keyword
- Avoid keyword stuffing
- Use title case

**Android Title Guidelines:**
- Maximum 50 characters
- Include 2-3 keywords naturally
- More flexible than iOS
- Can be more descriptive

#### 3.2 Subtitle (iOS) / Short Description (Android)
**Purpose**: Communicate unique value proposition

iOS Subtitle (30 chars):
- Feature-focused
- Benefit-driven
- Keyword-rich
- Examples: "Remove Backgrounds Instantly", "Track Calories, Lose Weight"

Android Short Description (80 chars):
- Hook users immediately
- Clear benefit statement
- Include call-to-action
- Examples: "Remove photo backgrounds in one tap. Over 10M downloads. Try free today!"

#### 3.3 Long Description
**Structure (4000 characters):**

```

**Writing Guidelines:**
1. Lead with benefits, not features
2. Use action verbs and emotional triggers

4. Address pain points directly
5. Create urgency ("Limited time offer", "Join 10M users")
6. Use formatting (emojis, bullet points) for scannability
7. Integrate keywords naturally (avoid stuffing)

### Phase 4: Creative Asset Optimization
**Objective**: Maximize conversion through visual storytelling

#### 4.1 App Icon Design Principles

3. **Key Feature 2**: Third most compelling feature
4. **Social Proof**: Ratings, testimonials, press mentions
5. **Additional Features**: Supporting features
6. **Call-to-Action**: Final push to install

**Design Guidelines:**
- Use captions/overlays to explain features
- Show app in context (device mockups)
- Consistent visual style (colors, fonts, layout)
- Portrait orientation (most users hold phone vertically)
- Localize text for each market
- Update regularly (seasonal, feature launches)

**Screenshot Copy Formula:**
```
[Headline] - Benefit-driven, 3-7 words
[Subheadline] - Supporting detail, 8-15 words
[Visual] - App interface demonstrating feature
```

#### 4.3 Preview Video Optimization
**Specs:**
- iOS: 15-30 seconds, portrait or landscape
- Android: Up to 30 seconds, landscape preferred

**Structure:**
```
0-3 sec: Hook (immediate problem/benefit)
3-12 sec: Solution demo (show app in action)
12-25 sec: Key features (2-3 features quickly)
25-30 sec: CTA (download now, try free, etc.)
```

**Best Practices:**
- No sound required (80% watch muted)
- Text overlays for key messages
- Fast-paced (attention span is short)
- Show real app interface
- Include captions for accessibility

- Visual style (bold vs. minimal)
- Device mockup vs. interface only
- Social proof placement

**Icon Tests:**
- Color schemes
- Symbol/logo variations
- Simplicity levels
- Text inclusion (Android)

**Copy Tests:**

#### 5.3 Statistical Significance
```python
# Minimum sample size calculator
from scipy import stats

def calculate_sample_size(baseline_cvr, minimum_detectable_effect, alpha=0.05, power=0.80):
    """
    Calculate required sample size for A/B test

    baseline_cvr: Current conversion rate (e.g., 0.30 = 30%)
    minimum_detectable_effect: Smallest change you want to detect (e.g., 0.05 = 5% improvement)
    alpha: Significance level (typically 0.05)
    power: Statistical power (typically 0.80)
    """
    # Implementation would calculate required sample size
    pass

# Example: 30% baseline CVR, want to detect 5% improvement
# Result: Need ~3,400 visitors per variant
```
