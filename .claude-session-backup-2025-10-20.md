# Session Context - 2025-10-20

## Problem Identified
Context is not carrying over between new Claude Code instances. When starting a new session, Claude has no memory of previous work despite having documentation in `.claude-session-context.md`.

## Solution Implemented: SessionStart Hook

### What We Built
Added an automated context injection system using Claude Code's built-in `SessionStart` hook feature.

**File Modified:** `.claude/settings.local.json`

**Hook Configuration Added:**
```json
"hooks": {
  "SessionStart": [
    {
      "matcher": "",
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "cat setup-navigator/.claude-session-context.md"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### How It Works
1. Every time a new Claude Code session starts in this project
2. The `SessionStart` hook automatically runs
3. It executes: `cat setup-navigator/.claude-session-context.md`
4. The output becomes available as session context automatically
5. Claude immediately knows about Setup Navigator and all previous work

### Why This Approach
✅ **Fully automated** - Zero user action required
✅ **Built-in feature** - No custom MCP server needed
✅ **Project-scoped** - Lives in `.claude/settings.local.json`
✅ **Zero overhead** - Simple shell command
✅ **Maintainable** - Update context file, changes auto-apply

### Documentation Sources
- Claude Code Hooks Guide: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks-guide.md
- Claude Code Hooks Reference: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks.md

### SessionStart Hook Details
**Available template variables:**
- `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` - File path for persisting environment variables
- `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` - Project root directory

**Hook input (via stdin):**
```json
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "~/.claude/projects/.../session.jsonl",
  "hook_event_name": "SessionStart",
  "source": "startup|resume|clear|compact"
}
```

**Context injection methods:**
1. Exit code 0 with stdout - Output becomes context automatically
2. JSON output with `additionalContext` field

### Testing Plan
1. End current session
2. Start new Claude Code session
3. Ask "What were we working on?" without providing context
4. Verify Claude knows about Setup Navigator immediately

### Context to Verify in Next Session
Claude should know about:
- **Setup Navigator** - Discovery system for Claude Code global setup
- **29 agents** discovered in ~/.claude/
- **12 skills** found
- **10 plugins** tracked
- **MCP Server** with 5 tools (setup_scan, setup_query, etc.)
- **Natural Language CLI** (`./bin/setup`)
- **Query Engine** with scored search
- **Model Distribution** - 75.9% Sonnet, 13.8% Opus, 10.3% Haiku

### Project Context Reference
Full project context is stored in: `setup-navigator/.claude-session-context.md`

This file contains:
- Project overview
- Current completion status
- What's been built (CLI, MCP server, query engine, analyzer, docs generator)
- Your setup (29 agents, 12 skills, 10 plugins)
- Installation status
- Quick commands
- Key files
- Test results
- Bug fixes during development
- Next steps

### Files Modified This Session
- `.claude/settings.local.json` - Added SessionStart hook configuration

### Success Criteria
✅ Hook configured correctly in settings.local.json
⏳ Next session: Claude has immediate context without being told
⏳ No manual context injection needed
⏳ System works automatically on every session start
