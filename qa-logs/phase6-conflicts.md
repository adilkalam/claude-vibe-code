# Phase 6: Conflicts & Contradictions Audit

**Started:** 2025-10-22T23:42:00
**Status:** IN PROGRESS

---

## Conflicts Found During Previous Phases

This phase consolidates conflicts discovered in Phases 1-5, plus additional analysis.

---

## Test Results

### Conflict Category 1: Design vs Reality [CRITICAL] üö®

**From:** Phase 2, Phase 5

**The Conflict:**
- **Design:** "Quality gates enforce thresholds, evidence required, blocks incomplete work"
- **Reality:** Gates don't enforce, evidence optional, work marked complete without files

**Evidence:**
- Phase 2: User reported agents claimed completion without building files
- Phase 2: quality-validator validates docs not code
- Phase 3: Evidence directory empty
- Phase 5: README claims enforcement that doesn't happen

**Impact:** CRITICAL - System fundamentally doesn't work as advertised

**Root Cause:** LLM guidance ‚â† automated enforcement

---

### Conflict Category 2: Multiple Context File Systems [MAJOR] ‚ö†Ô∏è

**From:** Phase 3

**The Conflict:**

| System | Purpose | Created By | Status |
|--------|---------|------------|--------|
| `.claude-orchestration-context.md` | Project type, agent team | SessionStart hook | EXISTS |
| `.claude-session-context.md` | Session persistence | /session-save | MISSING |
| `.orchestration/` | Workflow coordination | /orca | EXISTS |
| `.design-memory/` | Design patterns | Design commands | EXISTS |

**Problems:**
1. Naming collision: "orchestration context" used for 2 different things
2. Unclear which is canonical when purposes overlap
3. No documented relationship between systems
4. `.claude-session-context.md` never created (broken or unused?)

**Impact:** MAJOR - Confusion about where context lives

---

### Conflict Category 3: Enforcement Language Inconsistency [MAJOR] üö®

**From:** Phase 2 investigation

**The Conflict:**

**Weak Language (doesn't enforce):**
- "Verify evidence before proceeding"
- "Demand evidence"
- "Should check files"
- "Evidence when needed"

**Strong Language (implies enforcement):**
- "MUST verify"
- "NEVER accept claims without evidence"
- "BLOCKED until evidence provided"
- "100% required"

**Reality:** All language is guidance to LLM, none is enforced

**Impact:** MAJOR - Misleading promises

---

### Conflict Category 4: Agent Role Boundaries [MINOR] ‚ÑπÔ∏è

**From:** Phase 2

**Potential Overlaps:**
1. **frontend-engineer vs design-engineer**
   - Both can work on UI
   - Distinction: design creates systems, frontend implements
   - ‚úÖ Clear enough in practice

2. **backend-engineer vs infrastructure-engineer**
   - Distinction: backend=code, infrastructure=deployment
   - ‚úÖ Clear enough in practice

3. **workflow-orchestrator vs /orca command**
   - Both coordinate agents
   - Relationship unclear
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs clarification

**Impact:** MINOR - Mostly clear, some ambiguity

---

### Conflict Category 5: Evidence Requirements Vagueness [MAJOR] üö®

**From:** Phase 2, Phase 3

**The Conflict:**

**Vague statements:**
- "Evidence when needed"
- "Collect evidence"
- "Provide proof"

**Missing specifics:**
- WHAT evidence for WHICH change types?
- WHEN is evidence mandatory vs optional?
- WHERE does evidence go? (multiple locations possible)
- FORMAT requirements?

**Reality:** Agents don't know what to provide, validators don't know what to check

**Impact:** MAJOR - Unenforceable requirements

---

### Conflict Category 6: Documentation Claims vs Behavior [MAJOR] ‚ö†Ô∏è

**From:** Phase 5

**Claims in README/QUICK_REFERENCE:**
- "evidence-based verification for every change" ‚ùå
- "quality gates enforce thresholds" ‚ùå
- "blocks incomplete work" ‚ùå
- Examples show "Evidence: before.png, after.png" ‚ùå

**Reality from testing:**
- Evidence directory empty (Phase 3)
- Gates don't block (Phase 2)
- Incomplete work marked complete (Phase 2)

**Impact:** MAJOR - Docs promise features that don't work

---

### Conflict Category 7: Tool Usage Conflicts [PASS] ‚úì

**From:** Phase 2 verification

**Checked:**
- workflow-orchestrator: Read, Task, TodoWrite (no Write/Edit) ‚úì
- quality-validator: Has Read, Glob, Grep, Bash for verification ‚úì
- Implementation agents: Have Write, Edit for implementation ‚úì

**Finding:** No conflicts, tools appropriate for roles

---

### Conflict Category 8: Philosophy Consistency [CRITICAL] üö®

**From:** Overall analysis

**Stated Philosophy:**
- Evidence-based (not trust-based)
- 100% completion (not progressive)
- Block until quality met (not advisory)

**Actual Implementation:**
- Trust-based (accepts agent claims)
- Progressive (accepts partial)
- Advisory (suggestions not blocks)

**Impact:** CRITICAL - Core philosophy not implemented

---

### Conflict Category 9: Competing Ideas - Design Memory [MINOR] ‚ÑπÔ∏è

**From:** Phase 3

**Multiple storage systems:**
1. `.design-memory/` (general design storage)
2. `/design` command storage (where?)
3. `/save-inspiration` gallery (`.design-memory/visual-library/`)
4. `/agentfeedback --learn` rules (`.design-memory/design-rules/`?)

**Finding:** All use `.design-memory/` but unclear which subdirectory for what

**Impact:** MINOR - Works but could be clearer

---

### Conflict Category 10: Session Management Approaches [MAJOR] ‚ö†Ô∏è

**From:** Phase 3

**Multiple approaches:**
1. SessionStart hook auto-loads `.claude-orchestration-context.md` ‚úì
2. /session-save creates `.claude-session-context.md` ‚ùå (not working)
3. /session-resume loads context ‚ùå (no file to load)

**Conflict:** Two systems for same purpose, one doesn't work

**Impact:** MAJOR - Session persistence broken

---

### Conflict Category 11: Installation Instructions [PASS] ‚úì

**From:** Phase 5

**Checked:**
- README installation steps reference correct files ‚úì
- No "do this then do that instead" conflicts ‚úì
- Hook setup instructions consistent ‚úì

**Finding:** No conflicts

---

### Conflict Category 12: Command Overlap [MINOR] ‚ÑπÔ∏è

**From:** Phase 1, QUICK_REFERENCE

**/orca vs /enhance:**
- /orca: "complex multi-step tasks"
- /enhance: "vague requests ‚Üí structured execution"
- Distinction: /orca = full orchestration, /enhance = simpler
- ‚úÖ Decision tree in QUICK_REFERENCE clarifies when to use which

**/agentfeedback vs /clarify:**
- /agentfeedback: "parse feedback, dispatch agents"
- /clarify: "quick questions, no orchestration"
- ‚úÖ Clear distinction

**Finding:** Minimal overlap, decision guidance exists

---

## Phase 6 Summary

**Conflicts Audited:** 12 categories
**Critical:** 3 (Design vs Reality, Enforcement Language, Philosophy)
**Major:** 5 (Context Systems, Evidence Vagueness, Docs vs Behavior, Session Management)
**Minor:** 3 (Agent Roles, Design Memory, Command Overlap)
**Pass:** 2 (Tool Usage, Installation)

**Overall Finding:** System has **well-designed structure** but **broken enforcement**

### SCIENTIFIC BASIS: Why Enforcement Fails (Response Awareness Context)

**Added:** 2025-10-22T23:52:00

**After reviewing Response Awareness methodology and supporting research:**

**Root Cause is Architectural, Not Prompt Engineering:**

**Anthropic's Circuit Finding:**
Models have two circuits:
1. Evaluate if enough information exists
2. Generate response

**Critical:** Once in generation mode, model CANNOT STOP even when it realizes assumptions are being made.

**This explains ALL our enforcement failures:**

1. **quality-validator validates docs not code**
   - Still in generation context
   - Can't stop to run `ls` and verify files
   - Generates plausible-sounding validation
   
2. **Agents claim completion without building**
   - Generation mode requires completion
   - Can't stop mid-response to check work
   - Must generate "I completed X"

3. **Evidence directories stay empty**
   - Agents in generation flow
   - Taking screenshots = stopping generation
   - Generation pressure overrides verification

**The Science Says:**

**Li et al. (Metacognitive Space):**
- Models CAN monitor internal states
- Via EXPLICIT CONTROL (generating tokens)
- Along semantically meaningful axes
- #COMPLETION_DRIVE = explicit marker for "I'm assuming X"

**Didolkar et al. (Metacognitive Reuse):**
- Capture recurring patterns as behaviors
- Reuse without re-deriving
- 46% token reduction
- Applies to verification patterns

**Solution: Response Awareness Architecture**

**Not:** Make agents "verify better" (can't, generation mode)
**Instead:** Separate generation from verification

```
GENERATION PHASE:
  Agent writes code with explicit tags
  #COMPLETION_DRIVE: Assuming LoginView exists
  #COMPLETION_DRIVE: Assuming .frame(height: 44)
  
VERIFICATION PHASE (separate agent):
  grep "#COMPLETION_DRIVE" **/*.swift
  For each tag:
    - Read actual file
    - Verify assumption
    - Mark verified/failed
  Report findings
  Clean tags
```

**Quality gates become:**
- Count of unverified tags (must be 0)
- Verification agent must run
- All tags must be cleaned

**This is NOT prompt engineering. This is working WITH model architecture.**
