## Test Results


### Test 5.1: README.md Accuracy [MOSTLY PASS] ⚠️

**Timestamp:** 2025-10-22T23:37:00

**Claims Verified:**

✅ **Correct:**
- "13 slash commands" ✓ (matches actual count)
- "12 specialized agents" ✓ (matches actual count)
- Lists all agents with correct names ✓
- Lists all commands with correct names ✓
- Installation instructions reference correct files ✓
- Project structure diagram matches repo ✓

⚠️ **Misleading:**
- Claims "evidence-based verification for every change"
  - Reality: Evidence collection broken (Phase 2 finding)
- Claims "quality gates enforce thresholds"
  - Reality: Gates don't enforce, guidance only (Phase 2 finding)
- Claims "blocks incomplete work"
  - Reality: Agents complete without creating files (Phase 2 finding)
- Example outputs show "Evidence: before.png, after.png"
  - Reality: Evidence directory empty (Phase 3 finding)

**Severity:** Documentation describes DESIGN, not REALITY

**Status:** PASS (structurally accurate) with WARNING (behavior claims unverified)

---

### Test 5.2: QUICK_REFERENCE.md Accuracy [MOSTLY PASS] ⚠️

**Timestamp:** 2025-10-22T23:38:00

✅ **Correct:**
- "13 Total" commands ✓
- Agent descriptions match agent files ✓
- Command descriptions match command files ✓
- Suggested teams match hook detection ✓
- Decision tree is logical ✓

⚠️ **Same Issues as README:**
- "Evidence Required" claim unverified
- "Quality Validation" claim unverified  
- Workflow examples assume enforcement works

**Status:** PASS (accurate reference) with WARNING (same as README)

---

### Test 5.3: Agent Files Match Reality [PASS] ✓

**Timestamp:** 2025-10-22T23:39:00

- Agent frontmatter descriptions accurate ✓
- Tools listed match agent capabilities ✓
- Specializations clearly stated ✓
- auto_activate keywords make sense ✓

**Finding:** Agent markdown files ARE accurate about agent DESIGN

**Issue:** Can't verify agent BEHAVIOR matches design (would need integration tests)

**Status:** PASS (documentation accurate)

---

### Test 5.4: Command Files Match Reality [PASS] ✓

**Timestamp:** 2025-10-22T23:40:00

- Command descriptions accurate ✓
- allowed-tools listed correctly ✓
- argument-hints match usage ✓
- Commands reference correct agents ✓

**Finding:** Command markdown files ARE accurate about command DESIGN

**Issue:** Can't verify command BEHAVIOR without running them

**Status:** PASS (documentation accurate)

---

## Phase 5 Summary

**Tests Run:** 4
**Passed:** 4 (all docs structurally accurate)
**Warnings:** 2 (README/QUICK_REF claim unverified behavior)

**Key Findings:**

✅ **What's Accurate:**
- All counts correct (13 commands, 12 agents)
- All names and descriptions match files
- Installation instructions correct
- Project structure accurate
- Agent/command metadata correct

⚠️ **What's Misleading:**
- Docs describe INTENDED behavior
- Reality doesn't match (Phase 2/3 findings)
- Claims about enforcement unverified
- Example outputs show evidence that doesn't exist

**Recommendation:**
Add disclaimers:
- "⚠️ Note: Quality enforcement under development"
- Mark enforcement features as "Designed (not yet enforced)"
- Update examples to show actual (not ideal) output

**Phase 5 Status:** PASS (docs accurate to design) with WARNINGS (behavior unverified)
