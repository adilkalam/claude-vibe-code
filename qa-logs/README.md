# QA Audit Logs

**Each phase writes its own log file immediately upon completion.**

This prevents data loss if the audit crashes or is interrupted.

## Log Files

- `phase1-command-validation.md` - Command validation results
- `phase2-agent-orchestration.md` - Agent orchestration test results
- `phase3-context-flow.md` - Context/memory flow validation
- `phase4-integration.md` - Integration test results
- `phase5-documentation.md` - Documentation validation
- `phase6-conflicts.md` - Conflicts & contradictions audit
- `final-report.md` - Consolidated final report

## Progress Tracking

- `current-progress.md` - Always shows latest status, updated after each test
- Timestamp on each log entry
- Clear PASS/FAIL/IN_PROGRESS markers

## Recovery

If the audit crashes:
1. Check `current-progress.md` for last completed test
2. Review individual phase logs for results so far
3. Resume from last checkpoint
