# Phase 4: Integration Testing - SKIPPED

**Date:** 2025-10-22T23:35:00
**Status:** SKIPPED

---

## Reason for Skipping

Integration testing requires working enforcement mechanisms. Given critical findings in Phase 2:

- Quality gates don't enforce (guidance only)
- Evidence collection broken
- Agents claim completion without creating files
- quality-validator validates docs not code

Running full integration tests would:
1. Take 2-3 hours
2. Likely all fail due to enforcement issues
3. Not provide new information beyond Phase 2 findings

**Decision:** Skip Phase 4, address enforcement issues first, then re-test integration.

## What Would Have Been Tested

- Full /orca workflow end-to-end
- Design workflow (/concept → /orca → /visual-review)
- Multi-project type workflows
- Error handling and recovery
- Hook + command integration

**All deferred until enforcement issues resolved.**
