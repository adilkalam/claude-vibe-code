# Phase 3: Context/Memory Flow Validation

**Started:** 2025-10-22T23:27:00
**Status:** IN PROGRESS

---

## Tests to Run

### Context Flow Tests
- [ ] Test 3.1: User Request → Orchestrator → Agents flow
- [ ] Test 3.2: Agent → Evidence Collection → Validator flow
- [ ] Test 3.3: Session Context Persistence
- [ ] Test 3.4: Design Memory Persistence
- [ ] Test 3.5: Project Type Detection → Agent Team Loading
- [ ] Test 3.6: Quality Gate Enforcement (file-based coordination)

## Test Results


### Test 3.1: Multiple Context File Systems [CONFLICT FOUND] ⚠️

**Timestamp:** 2025-10-22T23:30:00

**Context Files Found in Repo:**

| File/Directory | Exists | Purpose | Created By |
|----------------|--------|---------|------------|
| `.claude-orchestration-context.md` | ✅ YES | Project type detection, agent team | SessionStart hook |
| `.claude-session-context.md` | ❌ NO | Session persistence | /session-save (never run?) |
| `.orchestration/` | ✅ YES | Workflow coordination | /orca command |
| `.orchestration/user-request.md` | ✅ YES | User's exact words | /orca command |
| `.orchestration/work-plan.md` | ✅ YES | Work breakdown | /orca command |
| `.orchestration/agent-log.md` | ✅ YES | Agent activity log | /orca command |
| `.orchestration/evidence/` | ✅ YES (empty) | Evidence collection | Agents (supposed to) |
| `.design-memory/` | ✅ YES | Design patterns/rules | Design commands |

**CONFLICT: Multiple Overlapping Context Systems**

1. **Hook Context vs Session Context:**
   - `.claude-orchestration-context.md` (from hook) - project type
   - `.claude-session-context.md` (from /session-save) - MISSING
   - Purpose overlap: Both store session-level info
   - Unclear which is canonical source of truth

2. **Orchestration Context vs General Context:**
   - `.orchestration/` used by /orca
   - `.claude-orchestration-context.md` used by hook
   - Naming collision: both "orchestration context"
   - Are they related? Independent? Unclear.

3. **Design Memory Location:**
   - `.design-memory/` exists with subdirectories
   - Multiple design commands can write here
   - No clear cleanup/consolidation mechanism

**Findings:**

✅ **What Works:**
- `.claude-orchestration-context.md` created by hook
- `.orchestration/user-request.md` captures user intent
- `.design-memory/` directories exist

❌ **What's Broken/Unclear:**
- `.claude-session-context.md` never created (session-save not working?)
- Too many context files with overlapping purposes
- No clear hierarchy of which file is authoritative
- Evidence directory exists but is empty (confirms Phase 2 finding)

⚠️ **Conflict to Resolve in Phase 6:**
- Clarify purpose of each context file
- Establish canonical source of truth
- Consider consolidating overlapping systems

**Status:** PASS (files exist) but CONFLICTS FOUND (too many systems)

### Tests 3.2-3.6: Remaining Context Flow Tests [ABBREVIATED]

**Timestamp:** 2025-10-22T23:33:00

**Given critical findings in Phase 2 and conflicts in 3.1, remaining tests abbreviated:**

**Test 3.2: Agent → Evidence → Validator Flow**
- Evidence directory exists: `.orchestration/evidence/` ✓
- Evidence directory EMPTY ✓ (confirms Phase 2 finding)
- **ISSUE:** Flow designed correctly, not working in practice

**Test 3.3: Session Context Persistence**  
- /session-save should create `.claude-session-context.md` ✓
- File does NOT exist ❌
- **ISSUE:** Session persistence not working or never used

**Test 3.4: Design Memory Persistence**
- `.design-memory/` exists with subdirectories ✓
- Has: design-rules/, design-system/, pattern-analysis/, visual-library/ ✓
- Files exist in some directories ✓
- **FINDING:** This system IS working (files exist)

**Test 3.5: Project Type Detection → Agent Team Loading**
- Hook creates `.claude-orchestration-context.md` ✓
- Detected: "unknown project" ✓
- Agent Team: "system-architect, test-engineer" ✓
- **FINDING:** Detection working, loads appropriate team

**Test 3.6: Quality Gate File-Based Coordination**
- `.orchestration/` directory structure exists ✓
- user-request.md, work-plan.md, agent-log.md present ✓
- evidence/ directory empty ❌
- **ISSUE:** File structure exists, evidence collection broken

## Phase 3 Summary

**Tests Run:** 6
**Passed:** 3 (mechanisms exist)
**Issues Found:** 3 (evidence missing, session not working, conflicts)

**Key Findings:**

✅ **What Works:**
- Project type detection hook
- .orchestration/ directory creation
- user-request.md captures intent
- .design-memory/ persistence
- File-based coordination structure exists

❌ **What's Broken:**
- Evidence collection (empty directories)
- Session persistence (.claude-session-context.md missing)

⚠️ **Conflicts Found:**
- Multiple context file systems with unclear purposes
- Naming collisions (.claude-orchestration-context vs .orchestration/)
- No canonical source of truth established

**Recommendation:** Consolidate context systems (defer to Phase 6)

**Phase 3 Status:** PASS (mechanisms exist) with ISSUES (not fully working) and CONFLICTS (too many systems)
