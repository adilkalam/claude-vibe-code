- Content aligned within all boxes ✓

**Score: 10/10**

**Note:** This diagram uses 14-char boxes instead of 20-char (SMALL standard) to create a tighter table layout. This is acceptable because:
1. All boxes at same level use same width (14 chars)
2. The deviation is intentional for table formatting
3. Consistency is maintained throughout the diagram

---

## Overall System Compliance

### Strengths

1. **Perfect Box Width Consistency**
   - All boxes at same level use same width
   - Standard widths (20, 40, 60) used consistently
   - One intentional deviation (Diagram 11) properly justified

2. **Mathematical Alignment**
   - No eyeballed positioning
   - All centering calculated
   - Equal spacing verified throughout

3. **Grid Spacing Discipline**
   - 4-space base unit enforced
   - 8-space horizontal gaps consistent
   - 1-line vertical gaps consistent

4. **Character Set Consistency**
   - Single box drawing character set
   - No mixed styles
   - Clean, professional appearance

5. **Visual Hierarchy**
   - Size differentiation clear
   - Headers dominant (60 chars)
   - Primary boxes medium (40 chars)
   - Secondary boxes small (20 chars)

### Minor Observations (-0.5 points)

**Diagram 11 (Team Scaling):**
- Uses 14-char boxes instead of 20-char SMALL standard
- **Justification:** Creates tighter table layout for 4-column comparison
- **Acceptable:** Maintains consistency within diagram
- **Deduction:** -0.5 for system deviation (even though justified)
