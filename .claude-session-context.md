**Project:** Claude Code Orchestration System
**Focus:** Documentation Redesign (COMPLETE)

## Recent Work

### ✅ Documentation Redesign (Complete)

**What was done:**
- Complete GitHub docs overhaul
- Navigation-first README (835 → 261 lines)
- Created 5 new doc files with real examples
- Sanitized all PeptideFox references
- Fixed session continuity system

**Files created:**
- `docs/SETUP.md` - Installation guide
- `docs/QUICKSTART.md` - Commands with real output
- `docs/WORKFLOWS.md` - 5 detailed scenarios
- `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Common problems
- `docs/OPTIMIZATION.md` - Token/cost savings
- `docs/REFERENCE.md` - CLI/API reference

**Key improvements:**
- Navigation section FIRST in README
- Real input → output format for all commands
- 0 sensitive references (PeptideFox → TaskFlow)
- All docs discoverable from navigation

**Status:** Ready to share with others

### ✅ Session Continuity System (Complete)

**What was done:**
- Added SessionStart hooks to both projects
- Created `/session-save` command (global)
- Created `/session-resume` command (global)
- Fixed hook path to use root-level context

**How it works:**
- SessionStart hook auto-loads `.claude-session-context.md`
- `/session-save` captures current session state
- `/session-resume` reloads context mid-session
