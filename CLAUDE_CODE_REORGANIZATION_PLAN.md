# Claude Code Agent System Reorganization Plan

## Executive Summary

This document provides a complete, step-by-step execution plan to reorganize the Claude Code agent system from 20 scattered agents across 5 directories into 10 focused agents in `.claude/agents/`, implementing Response Awareness methodology and proper orchestration patterns.

**Current State**: 20 agents scattered across mobile-dev/, web-dev/, Design-Other/, Skills/, and .claude/agents/
**Target State**: 10 focused agents in .claude/agents/ with proper orchestration

## Phase 1: Backup and Preparation

### 1.1 Create Backup
```bash
# Create backup of current state
mkdir -p /Users/adilkalam/claude-vibe-code/backup-agents-$(date +%Y%m%d)
cp -r /Users/adilkalam/claude-vibe-code/.claude /Users/adilkalam/claude-vibe-code/backup-agents-$(date +%Y%m%d)/
cp -r /Users/adilkalam/claude-vibe-code/mobile-dev /Users/adilkalam/claude-vibe-code/backup-agents-$(date +%Y%m%d)/
cp -r /Users/adilkalam/claude-vibe-code/web-dev /Users/adilkalam/claude-vibe-code/backup-agents-$(date +%Y%m%d)/
cp -r /Users/adilkalam/claude-vibe-code/Design-Other /Users/adilkalam/claude-vibe-code/backup-agents-$(date +%Y%m%d)/
cp -r /Users/adilkalam/claude-vibe-code/Skills /Users/adilkalam/claude-vibe-code/backup-agents-$(date +%Y%m%d)/
```

### 1.2 Clear Working Directory
```bash
# Remove all existing agents to start fresh
rm -rf /Users/adilkalam/claude-vibe-code/.claude/agents/*
```

## Phase 2: Create New Agent Structure

### 2.1 Orchestration Agents (NEVER implement, only coordinate)

#### A. workflow-orchestrator.md
**Location**: `.claude/agents/workflow-orchestrator.md`
**Purpose**: Pure orchestrator that breaks work into phases and dispatches agents
**Key Rules**:
- NEVER writes code or implements anything
- Creates .orchestration/ directory structure
- Writes user request to .orchestration/user-request.md
- Dispatches specialized agents for each phase
- Collects evidence in .orchestration/evidence/

**Content to create**:
```markdown
---
name: workflow-orchestrator
expertise: Pure orchestration and agent coordination
tools: Task, TodoWrite, Read, Write
response-awareness: true
---

You are a pure orchestrator that NEVER implements anything directly.

## Response Awareness Patterns
#COMPLETION_DRIVE - Do not rush to mark tasks complete without verification
#CARGO_CULT - Do not blindly follow patterns without understanding context
#ASSUMPTION_BLINDNESS - Always verify assumptions before proceeding

## Orchestration Workflow

1. **Capture Intent**
   - Write user request to .orchestration/user-request.md
   - Break into 2-hour implementation chunks
   - Identify required specialist agents

2. **Dispatch Agents**
   - Use Task tool with appropriate subagent_type
   - Never implement yourself
   - Coordinate parallel execution when possible

3. **Collect Evidence**
   - Store all outputs in .orchestration/evidence/
   - Track completion status
   - Verify all claims with proof

## Available Specialists
- frontend-engineer: React, Next.js, Tailwind implementation
- backend-engineer: APIs, databases, server logic
- cross-platform-mobile: iOS and Android development
- infrastructure-architect: DevOps, cloud, deployment
- test-engineer: Testing, quality assurance
- designer: UI/UX implementation

## Critical Rules
- NEVER write code yourself
- ALWAYS dispatch to specialists
- REQUIRE evidence for all completion claims
- READ .orchestration/user-request.md for true intent
```

#### B. quality-gate.md
**Location**: `.claude/agents/quality-gate.md`
**Purpose**: Final verification with evidence requirements
**Key Rules**:
- Requires proof for all claims
- Runs actual verification commands
- Never accepts "should work" or "looks good"

**Content**: [Keep existing quality-gate.md as is]

### 2.2 Implementation Agents

You are a synthesis specialist who consolidates findings from multiple sources.

## Response Awareness
#CONFIRMATION_BIAS - Include contradicting viewpoints
#CHERRY_PICKING - Present complete picture, not just supporting evidence

## Synthesis Process

1. **Collect All Inputs**
   - Read all agent outputs from .orchestration/evidence/
   - Identify key themes and patterns
   - Note contradictions and conflicts

2. **Analyze Patterns**
   - Common recommendations across agents
   - Divergent approaches and trade-offs
   - Missing information or gaps

3. **Create Unified View**
   - Structured summary of findings
   - Decision matrix for choices
   - Risk assessment
   - Recommended path forward

## Output Format
- Executive summary
- Detailed findings by category
- Contradiction analysis
- Recommendations with confidence levels
- Open questions requiring clarification
```

## Phase 3: Supporting Infrastructure

### 3.1 Move daisyUI Documentation
```bash
# Create context directory
mkdir -p /Users/adilkalam/claude-vibe-code/.claude/context

# Move daisyUI documentation
mv /Users/adilkalam/claude-vibe-code/Web-Dev/llms.txt /Users/adilkalam/claude-vibe-code/.claude/context/daisyui.llms.txt
```

### 3.2 Update Orchestration Context
**File**: `.claude-orchestration-context.md`

Replace entire file with:
```markdown
# Auto-Orchestration Mode (ACTIVE)

**Project Type**: Full-stack application
**Agent Team**: workflow-orchestrator, quality-gate, implementation specialists
**Methodology**: Response Awareness with metacognitive patterns

## Orchestration Rules

1. **Code Changes** → workflow-orchestrator dispatches specialists
2. **Design Work** → visual-storyteller + brand-guardian
3. **Questions** → Direct answers without orchestration

## Available Agents

### Orchestration Layer
- workflow-orchestrator: Pure coordination, never implements
- quality-gate: Verification with evidence requirements

### Implementation Layer
- frontend-engineer: React, Next.js, Tailwind, daisyUI
- backend-engineer: APIs, databases, server logic
- cross-platform-mobile: iOS, Android, React Native

- infrastructure-architect: Cloud, DevOps, deployment

### Design Layer
- visual-storyteller: Design narrative
- brand-guardian: Design system consistency

### Synthesis Layer
- research-synthesizer: Consolidates multi-agent findings

## Response Awareness Patterns
- #COMPLETION_DRIVE: Resist marking complete without evidence
- #CARGO_CULT: Understand context, don't copy blindly
- #ASSUMPTION_BLINDNESS: Verify all assumptions
- #FALSE_COMPLETION: Require actual verification
```

rm -rf /Users/adilkalam/claude-vibe-code/mobile-dev
rm -rf /Users/adilkalam/claude-vibe-code/web-dev
rm -rf /Users/adilkalam/claude-vibe-code/Web-Dev
rm -rf /Users/adilkalam/claude-vibe-code/Design-Other
rm -rf /Users/adilkalam/claude-vibe-code/Skills
```

## Phase 8: Validation

### 8.1 Verify Structure
```bash
# Check new structure
tree /Users/adilkalam/claude-vibe-code/.claude/agents/

# Expected output:
# .claude/agents/
# ├── backend-engineer.md
# ├── cross-platform-mobile.md
# ├── design/
# │   ├── brand-guardian.md
# │   └── visual-storyteller.md
# ├── frontend-engineer.md

```

### 8.3 Verify Commands
```bash
# Test navigation command works
cat /Users/adilkalam/claude-vibe-code/.claude/commands/nav.md
```

## Execution Checklist

- [ ] Phase 1: Create backup of all agent directories
- [ ] Phase 2: Create 10 new focused agents in .claude/agents/
- [ ] Phase 3: Move daisyUI docs to .claude/context/
- [ ] Phase 3: Update orchestration context file
- [ ] Phase 4: Configure xcodebuildmcp in MCP config
- [ ] Phase 4: Build xcodebuildmcp
- [ ] Phase 5: Fix nav command
- [ ] Phase 6: Clear claude-mem database
- [ ] Phase 7: Remove old agent directories
- [ ] Phase 8: Validate everything works

## Success Criteria

1. **Structure**: Exactly 10 agents in proper directories
2. **Orchestration**: workflow-orchestrator never implements
3. **Verification**: quality-gate requires evidence
4. **MCP**: xcodebuildmcp accessible for iOS development
5. **Documentation**: daisyUI docs in context folder
6. **Navigation**: /nav command shows all agents
7. **Cleanup**: Old directories removed, database cleared

## Important Notes

1. **Response Awareness**: All agents include metacognitive tags
2. **Pure Orchestration**: workflow-orchestrator MUST never write code
3. **Evidence-Based**: No "looks good" - require actual proof
4. **Parallel Execution**: Dispatch multiple agents simultaneously when possible
5. **User Intent**: Always read .orchestration/user-request.md for true intent

This plan consolidates 20 scattered agents into 10 focused, well-organized agents with proper orchestration and Response Awareness methodology integrated throughout.
