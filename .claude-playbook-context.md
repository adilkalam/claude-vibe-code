# ACE Playbook System - Loaded Patterns

**System:** Agentic Context Engineering (ACE) with Generator-Reflector-Curator architecture
**Status:** Active and learning

---

## What Are Playbooks?

Playbooks are collections of **proven strategies** that /orca has learned from past sessions. They contain:
- ✓ **Helpful patterns** (strategies that worked)
- ✗ **Anti-patterns** (strategies that failed)
- ○ **Neutral patterns** (context-dependent)

Each pattern includes:
- **Context:** When to use this pattern
- **Strategy:** What to do (or avoid)
- **Evidence:** Why it works/fails
- **Counts:** helpful_count / harmful_count (updated by curator)

## How /orca Uses Playbooks

When you run `/orca`, it will:

1. **Match patterns** to your request using context keywords
2. **Select specialists** based on proven strategies
3. **Avoid anti-patterns** that have failed before
4. **Dispatch team** in parallel when possible
5. **Log outcomes** to signal log
6. **Reflect on session** (orchestration-reflector)
7. **Update playbooks** (playbook-curator)

**Example:**

User: "Build iOS app with local data storage"

Pattern matched: `ios-pattern-001` (SwiftUI + SwiftData + State-First)
Strategy: Dispatch swiftui-developer + swiftdata-specialist + state-architect
Evidence: Modern iOS development best practice, proven across X sessions

## Pattern Evolution

Patterns evolve based on real outcomes:

- **Successful session** → helpful_count incremented
- **Failed session** → harmful_count incremented
- **harmful_count > helpful_count × 3** → Apoptosis (pattern deleted after 7-day grace period)
- **New pattern discovered** → Appended to playbook with evidence

## Available Commands

- `/orca` - Multi-agent orchestration (uses playbooks automatically)
- `/playbook-review` - Manually trigger reflection and curation
- `/playbook-pause` - Temporarily disable playbook system
