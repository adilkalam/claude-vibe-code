# Session Context - 2025-10-21

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-21 (Auto-generated)
**Session Focus:** iOS app development + Session continuity system setup

---

## Current Tasks

Building automated session continuity system:
- ✅ Added SessionStart hook to auto-load context
- ✅ Created /session-save command for manual backups
- ✅ Created /session-resume command to reload context
- Testing the complete system

---

## Recent Work

**iOS Development:**
- Fixed iOS build errors and integrated feature files
- Resolved missing Swift files in Xcode project
- Updated app icon to fox logo (without text)
- Enhanced loading animation design
- Added comprehensive session log

**Session Continuity:**
- Diagnosed why session context wasn't loading (no hook in peptidefoxv2)
- Configured SessionStart hook in .claude/settings.local.json
- Built /session-save and /session-resume commands
- Created initial session context file

**Modified Files:**
- `.claude/settings.local.json` - Added SessionStart hook
- `.claude/commands/session-save.md` - New command
- `.claude/commands/session-resume.md` - New command
- `ios-design-system/inspiration/` - New directory (untracked)

**Recent Commits:**
1. `751aab8` - docs: add comprehensive session log for 2025-10-21
2. `7041077` - feat: update loading animation and app icon design
3. `c02feb0` - chore: update app icon to fox logo without text
4. `6598928` - fix: add missing Swift files to Xcode project and resolve build errors
5. `19870f4` - fix: resolve iOS build errors and integrate all feature files

## Decisions & Context

**Problem Identified:**
Session context was working in claude-vibe-code project but NOT in peptidefoxv2. The SessionStart hook was missing from peptidefoxv2's settings.

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Added SessionStart hook to peptidefoxv2/.claude/settings.local.json
2. Hook auto-loads .claude-session-context.md on every session start
3. Created /session-save for manual context capture
4. Created /session-resume for mid-session reload

**How It Works:**
- SessionStart hook runs on every new session
- Loads .claude-session-context.md automatically
- Falls back to "New Session" message if no context exists
- /session-save lets you manually capture state
- /session-resume lets you reload context mid-session

---

## Next Session

When you return:
- Test session continuity by restarting Claude Code
- Verify SessionStart hook auto-loads this context
- Continue with iOS app development work
- Or use /session-save to update context before ending session

---

## Project Context

**Project:** PeptideFox v2
**Stack:**
- iOS: Swift, SwiftUI, Xcode
- Web: Next.js 15, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
**Build Tools:** Bun (web), Xcode (iOS)
**Deploy:** Cloudflare Pages (web), App Store (iOS)

**Key Directories:**
- `PeptideFox/` - iOS app source
- `app/` - Next.js web app
- `components/` - React components
- `.claude/` - Claude Code config, commands, agents

## How Session Continuity Works

**Automatic (on session start):**
1. Open Claude Code in this project
2. SessionStart hook fires automatically
3. Runs: `cat .claude-session-context.md`
4. Context loads into session
5. Claude knows what you were working on

**Manual (mid-session):**
- `/session-save` - Capture current state
- `/session-resume` - Reload context

**File Location:**
`.claude-session-context.md` (project root)
