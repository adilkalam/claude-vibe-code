# GLOW/KLOW Blend System Implementation Summary

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created
1. **BlendVariantPickerView.swift** (/Users/adilkalam/Desktop/OBDN/peptidefoxv2/peptidefox-ios/PeptideFox/Core/Presentation/Calculator/BlendVariantPickerView.swift)
   - Modal picker for selecting GLOW/KLOW variants
   - Shows 6 preset variants plus custom option
   - Displays blend composition and total mg

2. **BlendCompositionCard.swift** (/Users/adilkalam/Desktop/OBDN/peptidefoxv2/peptidefox-ios/PeptideFox/Core/Presentation/Calculator/BlendCompositionCard.swift)
   - Interactive card showing peptide sliders
   - BPC-157, TB-500, GHK-Cu sliders (1-10mg, 1-10mg, 5-100mg)
   - KPV slider for KLOW blends (10-50mg)
   - Auto-calculates total vial size

### Modified Files
1. **CompoundPickerView.swift**
   - Added 4th button "GLOW/KLOW" to featured grid
   - Added `onSelectBlend` callback
   - Triggers BlendVariantPickerView sheet

2. **CalculatorViewModel.swift**
   - Added `selectedBlend: BlendComposition?`
   - Added `isBlendMode: Bool`
   - Added `selectBlend(_ blendType: BlendType)` method
   - Added `updateBlendComposition()` method for ratio-locked updates
   - Auto-calculates vial size from blend total

3. **CalculatorView.swift**
   - Added BlendCompositionCard display when in blend mode
   - Modified vial size input to show auto-calculated value in blend mode
   - Updated compound selection display to show blend name
   - Added `onSelectBlend` handler

### Existing File (Already in Project)
1. **BlendComposition.swift** (/Users/adilkalam/Desktop/OBDN/peptidefoxv2/peptidefox-ios/PeptideFox/Core/Models/BlendComposition.swift)
   - Contains BlendType, BlendVariant enums
   - Contains BlendComposition struct with factory methods

## Manual Steps Required in Xcode

### Step 1: Add Missing Files to Project
The following files exist on disk but need to be added to the Xcode project:

1. Open `/Users/adilkalam/Desktop/OBDN/peptidefoxv2/peptidefox-ios/PeptideFox.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Right-click on `PeptideFox/Core/Presentation/Calculator` group
3. Select "Add Files to PeptideFox..."
4. Navigate to and select:
   - BlendVariantPickerView.swift
   - BlendCompositionCard.swift
5. Ensure "Add to targets: PeptideFox" is checked
6. Click "Add"

### Step 2: Verify BlendComposition.swift
1. In Xcode Project Navigator, find `BlendComposition.swift`
2. It should be located under `PeptideFox/Core/Models/`
3. Verify it's included in "PeptideFox" target (check File Inspector)
4. If it's missing or shows an error, re-add it:
   - Right-click on `PeptideFox/Core/Models` group
   - Select "Add Files to PeptideFox..."
   - Navigate to `/Users/adilkalam/Desktop/OBDN/peptidefoxv2/peptidefox-ios/PeptideFox/Core/Models/BlendComposition.swift`
   - Add to PeptideFox target

### Step 3: Clean Build and Test
1. Product → Clean Build Folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
2. Product → Build (Cmd+B)
3. Fix any remaining errors (should build successfully now)

## Testing Checklist

### Functional Tests
- [ ] GLOW/KLOW button appears as 4th featured compound
- [ ] Tapping GLOW/KLOW opens blend variant picker
- [ ] Selecting a GLOW variant (5/10/30, 10/10/50, 10/10/70) works
- [ ] Selecting a KLOW variant (10/10/10/35, 10/10/10/50) works
- [ ] Blend composition card appears after selection
- [ ] BPC-157 slider adjusts (1-10mg)
- [ ] TB-500 slider adjusts (1-10mg)
- [ ] GHK-Cu slider adjusts (5-100mg)
- [ ] KPV slider appears for KLOW blends (10-50mg)
- [ ] Vial size auto-calculates from blend total
- [ ] Vial size field shows "(auto-calculated)" label in blend mode
- [ ] Calculator still works for non-blend compounds
- [ ] Reset button clears blend state

### UI/UX Tests
- [ ] 4-column grid layout looks balanced
- [ ] Blend variant picker displays properly
- [ ] Composition card displays cleanly
- [ ] Sliders are responsive
- [ ] All text is legible
- [ ] Transitions are smooth

## Known Limitations
1. Vial size is auto-calculated in blend mode (user cannot manually adjust)
2. Ratio-locking not yet implemented (sliders adjust independently)
3. Custom cocktail option creates a default blend (customization UI not yet implemented)

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
1. Implement ratio-locked sliders (maintain peptide ratios when adjusting)
2. Add custom cocktail builder UI
3. Save/load blend presets
4. Add blend validation (e.g., warn if concentrations are unusual)
5. Display individual peptide concentrations (mg/ml for each component)

## Build Error Resolution

If you encounter "cannot find type 'BlendComposition' in scope" errors:

1. Verify BlendComposition.swift is in the project
2. Check it's marked as part of PeptideFox target
3. Clean build folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
4. Delete Derived Data:
   ```
   rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
   ```
5. Restart Xcode
6. Build again
