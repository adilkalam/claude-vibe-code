### Data Stored Locally on Your Device

PeptideFox stores the following information **locally on your device only**:

- **Peptide Protocols**: Your custom peptide protocols, including peptide selections, dosages, and schedules
- **Calculation History**: Recent reconstitution calculations and supply planning data
- **User Preferences**: App settings such as dark mode preference, default units, and measurement systems

- Your medical history or health conditions
- Your location data
- Your device identifiers
- Analytics or usage statistics
- Crash reports with personal information
- Any personally identifiable information (PII)

## How We Use Your Information

1. **Provide Core Functionality**: Calculate dosages, plan supplies, and manage protocols
2. **Personalize Your Experience**: Remember your preferences and recent calculations
3. **Maintain App State**: Restore your protocols and settings when you reopen the app

## Data Sharing and Third Parties

**We do not share any data with third parties** because we don't collect any data in the first place.

- **No Advertising Networks**: We do not integrate advertising SDKs
- **No Cloud Sync**: We do not sync your data to cloud servers
- **No Third-Party SDKs**: We do not use third-party libraries that collect data

---

## Data Security

### Local Storage Security

Your data is protected by:
- **iOS Security**: Standard iOS sandboxing and file protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: iOS encrypts data on device when locked (standard iOS behavior)
- **No Network Transmission**: Data never transmitted over network
- **App Sandboxing**: Data only accessible by PeptideFox app

### Photo Library Access (Optional)

PeptideFox may request access to your photo library **only** for the following purposes:

**You control photo library access** and can revoke it at any time in iOS Settings → PeptideFox → Photos.

### Camera Access (Future Feature - Optional)

Camera access will only be requested if you use this feature, and you can deny or revoke access at any time.
