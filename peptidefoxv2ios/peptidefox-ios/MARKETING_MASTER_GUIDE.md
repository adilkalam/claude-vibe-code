### Pitch Template

**Subject**: Introducing PeptideFox: First Medical-Grade Peptide Calculator for iOS

**Body**:
```
Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out to share PeptideFox, a new iOS app launching [Date] that brings medical-grade precision to peptide therapy dosing.

Why this matters:
Peptide therapy is growing rapidly (GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic, regenerative peptides like BPC-157), but dosing tools have lagged behind. Most practitioners use spreadsheets or generic calculators that lack safety validation and precision.

What PeptideFox does:
• Medical-grade calculator (±0.001mL accuracy)
• Safety validation (drug interactions, dose limits)
• 30+ research-backed peptides with clinical protocols
• Privacy-first design (no data collection)
• Completely free

The unique angle:
PeptideFox is built by [peptide researchers/longevity practitioners] who needed better tools for their own practice. It's validated against clinical protocols and designed for professionals, but accessible to anyone doing peptide therapy under medical supervision.

Would you be interested in covering the launch? I can provide:
• Exclusive early access
• Demo walkthrough
• Founder interview
• Complete press kit

Press kit: [Link to press kit]
TestFlight: [Link for early access]

Happy to answer any questions.

Best,
[Your Name]

## Appendix: Marketing Philosophy

### Core Principles

**1. Education-First**
We're not just selling an app—we're educating users about safe, precise peptide dosing. Every piece of content should provide value beyond "download our app."

**2. Privacy as Differentiation**
In an era of surveillance capitalism, our privacy-first approach is a major differentiator. Always emphasize: no tracking, no data collection, no compromises.

**3. Medical Credibility**
PeptideFox is a medical-grade tool, not a consumer app. Maintain professional tone, cite sources, and always emphasize safety and physician consultation.

**4. Community-Driven Development**
Users are our product team. Feature requests, bug reports, and feedback drive our roadmap. Make users feel heard and valued.

**5. Transparency Always**
Be honest about limitations, acknowledge mistakes quickly, and communicate openly. Trust is earned through transparency.

### Brand Voice
