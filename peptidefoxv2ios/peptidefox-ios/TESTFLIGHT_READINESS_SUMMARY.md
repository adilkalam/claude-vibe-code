6. Build to verify (Cmd+B)
```

### Step 2: Create Placeholder App Icon (15 minutes)
**Option A - Quick Blue Square**:
```
1. Open any image editor (Preview, Photoshop, Figma)
2. Create 1024x1024 canvas
3. Fill with #007AFF (iOS blue)
4. Add white "PF" text, centered, 400pt

3. Export at 1024x1024
4. Edit to add blue background
5. Save as icon-1024.png
6. Place in Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/
```

### Step 3: Build Navigation Structure (1-2 hours)
```swift
// In PeptideFoxApp.swift
@main
struct PeptideFoxApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            TabView {
                GLPJourneyView()
                    .tabItem {
                        Label("GLP-1", systemImage: "chart.line.uptrend.xyaxis")
                    }
                
                // TODO: Add other views
                // ReconstitutionCalculatorView()
                //     .tabItem { Label("Calculator", systemImage: "flask") }
                
                // ProtocolBuilderView()
                //     .tabItem { Label("Protocols", systemImage: "list.bullet.clipboard") }
                
                // PeptideLibraryView()
                //     .tabItem { Label("Library", systemImage: "book") }
                
                AboutView()
                    .tabItem {
                        Label("About", systemImage: "info.circle")
                    }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Implement Missing Views (2-3 weeks)
Priority order:
1. **ReconstitutionCalculatorView** (highest priority - core feature)
2. **SupplyPlannerView** (high priority - differentiator)
3. **PeptideLibraryView** (medium priority - informational)
4. **ProtocolBuilderView** (lower priority - advanced feature)

### Step 5: Create Screenshots (1 week)
Only after views are implemented and polished

### Step 6: Set Up Website Pages (2-3 days)
1. Host privacy policy at /privacy
2. Create support/FAQ page at /support
3. Verify marketing page at root

### Step 7: TestFlight Upload (1 day)
Once all above is complete

## Key Decisions Made

1. **iOS 17+ Only** - Taking advantage of latest APIs, simplifies development
2. **Privacy-First** - No tracking, no analytics, local-only data
3. **Medical Disclaimer** - Prominent in About view and App Store description
4. **Free App** - No pricing tier (can be changed later)
5. **Manual Release** - Recommended to control launch timing
6. **No iCloud Sync** - v1.0 local-only, can add in v1.1+
7. **Placeholder Icon OK** - Can use simple icon for TestFlight, improve for App Store
8. **17+ Age Rating** - Due to medical/treatment information
