# iOS App Session Log - October 21, 2025

## Session Overview
Successfully fixed all build errors, integrated missing files, updated loading animation, and prepared design system improvements.

---

## ✅ Completed Work

### 1. Build System Fixes
**Problem**: App had multiple missing Swift files causing build failures

**Files Added to Xcode Project**:
- `Color+Hex.swift` - Protocol theme colors (protocolBackground, protocolCard, protocolText)
- `FontSize.swift` - Font size preference enum
- `ProtocolOutputView.swift` - Main protocol output view
- `CompoundPickerView.swift` - Calculator compound picker component
- `GLPProtocolOutputView.swift` - GLP-1 specific protocol output view

**Build Status**:
- ✅ BUILD SUCCEEDED
- ✅ App installs and runs on iPhone 17 Pro Simulator
- ✅ No crashes detected

**Git Commits**:
- `6598928` - Fix: add missing Swift files to Xcode project
- `c02feb0` - Chore: update app icon to fox logo
- `7041077` - Feat: update loading animation and app icon design

### 2. Loading Animation Updates
**File**: `PeptideFox/Views/LoadingView.swift`

**Changes Made**:
- Slowed rotation speed by 50% (0.8s → 1.6s per rotation)
- Reduced spin time from 1.5s to 1.0s
- Adjusted fade-out timing (2.5s → 2.0s)

**New Timeline**:
- **0-1s**: Slow, smooth spinning
- **1-2s**: Logo stabilizes with spring bounce + text fades in
- **2-2.5s**: Everything fades out and dismisses

### 3. App Icon Design
**File**: `PeptideFox/Resources/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/AppIcon-1024.png`

**Updates**:
- Added white background to app icon
- Added 134px padding on all sides
- Logo centered at 755x768px on 1024x1024 canvas (75% of space)
- Professional, clean appearance on home screen

**Script Created**: `create_padded_icon.swift` for reusable icon generation

## 🎯 Pending Tasks (10 items)

### Task 1: Update CompoundPickerView UI
**File**: `PeptideFox/Core/Presentation/Calculator/CompoundPickerView.swift`

**Changes Needed**:
- Add Semaglutide button BEFORE NAD+ in Featured section
- Remove "Cocktail" text from GLOW/KLOW badges
- Replace "Cocktail" filter with "Blend"
- **CRITICAL**: Replace filter pills (All/Cocktails/Regular) with search bar
  - User feedback: "I literally didn't see the search bar"
  - Search should be prominent, not hidden
  - Filters are not helpful (cocktails already at top)

### Task 2: Implement Cocktail Blend Multi-Compound Dosing
**Context**: Cocktail blends (GLOW, KLOW) have multiple compounds with specific ratios

**Required Functionality**:
1. Split dosing by compound first
2. Dosing slider becomes SUM of parts
3. Show individual compound ratios below (NO sliders)
4. Ratios entered in Step 1 should persist

**Example**: GLOW 5/10/30
- 5mg Semaglutide
- 10mg Tirzepatide
- 30mg something else
- User adjusts total dose, individual compounds scale by ratio

### Task 3: Always Show Vial Size & Concentration Fields
**File**: Calculator view

**Current Issue**: Fields only appear after selection
**Required**: Always visible with grey state when empty

**Logic**:
- Show vial size field (greyed out, text: "-" or "n/a")
- Show desired concentration field (greyed out)
- Rest of calculator elements visible but disabled
- Button greyed out until both filled
- **Reasoning**: Advanced users want to calculate quickly without dropdown

### Task 4: Remove Glass Effect from Protocol Page
**File**: Protocol tab view

**Changes**:
- Remove glass/frosted effect
- Hide bar with clear swipe-up gesture
- Add visual affordance for swipe interaction
- Clean, simple implementation

### Task 5: Move Profile from Tab Bar to Corner Icon
**Files**:
- `PeptideFox/Core/Presentation/ContentView.swift` (remove from TabView)
- Add profile icon to navigation bar (top right or left)

**Design Pattern**: Like inspiration examples - profile is secondary, not focal point

### Task 6: Make GLP Page Cards Collapsible
**File**: GLP-1 Journey page

**Required**:
- Cards should collapse to just: Title, Subtext, Description
- Allow all cards to appear at once when collapsed
- Expandable on tap
- Progressive disclosure pattern from inspiration

### Task 7: Update GLP-1 Journey Header
**Changes**:
- Replace "GLP 1 journey" text above 1-2-3 steps with badge
- Change text to: "GLP-1 Protocol Tool"
- Follow design system for badge styling

### Task 8: Fix Frequency Page Card Sizing
**File**: Dosing frequency page

**CRITICAL DESIGN VIOLATION**: Cards are different heights
**Required**:
- Make ALL cards collapsible (same as Task 6)
- Ensure ALL cards have SAME HEIGHT (cardinal sin violation)
- Consistent spacing/padding
- Visual rhythm through uniform sizing

### Task 9: Remove Banner
**Text to Remove**: "This is the most..."

**Reasoning**: Will add this functionality later, it's secondary
**Action**: Simply remove/hide the banner for now

### Task 10: Add Protocol CTA & Create Placeholder
**Required**:
1. Add "Add to Protocol" CTA button after calculator is filled out
2. Replace current protocol page with placeholder
3. Placeholder text: `[PLACEHOLDER - CALENDAR, COMPOUNDS, DOSING SCHEDULE]`
4. Future: Will build calendar-type feature with phases

**Note**: Keep it simple for now, full implementation comes later

## 🎨 Design System Analysis (from /inspire)

### Inspiration Sources Analyzed (6 designs)
Location: `/Users/adilkalam/Desktop/OBDN/peptidefoxv2/ios-design-system/inspiration/`

### Extracted Aesthetic Principles

**1. Breathing Room & Hierarchy**:
- Generous whitespace between ALL elements
- Clean typography with clear size hierarchy
- Single focal point per screen
- Content in consistent cards/modules

**2. Consistent Sizing** (CRITICAL):
- Cards in grids ALWAYS same height
- Uniform padding across all cards
- Aligned elements create visual rhythm
- **This is the #1 cardinal sin to avoid**

**3. Subtle Depth**:
- Light shadows for elevation (never heavy)
- Subtle borders on form fields
- Clean modals that overlay content
- NO glass effects or heavy gradients

**4. Color Strategy**:
- Mostly monochrome with single accent color
- Accent colors used sparingly (green=success, yellow=warning, red=alert)
- Color-coded data visualization
- Muted backgrounds

**5. Interaction Patterns**:
- Collapsible/expandable cards for progressive disclosure
- Pill-shaped buttons with clear CTAs
- Profile icons in top corners (never in main nav)
- Search bars PROMINENT and easy to find
- Clean segmented controls

### Design Violations to Fix

Current violations identified:
- ❌ Filter pills cluttering UI → ✅ Clean search bar
- ❌ Inconsistent card heights → ✅ Uniform sizing
- ❌ Profile in tab bar → ✅ Corner icon
- ❌ Glass effects → ✅ Clean swipe interaction
- ❌ Non-collapsible cards → ✅ Progressive disclosure
- ❌ Hidden search bar → ✅ Prominent placement

## 🔧 Technical Notes

### Project.pbxproj Management
**Lessons Learned**:
1. Always close Xcode before modifying project.pbxproj programmatically
2. Python scripts must track sections properly (PBXBuildFile, PBXFileReference, PBXGroup, PBXSourcesBuildPhase)
3. File paths must be relative to parent group's path
4. Keep backups of working project.pbxproj

**Scripts Created**:
- `add_color_hex_fixed.py` - Adds files with section tracking
- `add_missing_files.py` - Batch file addition
- `add_compound_picker.py` - Single file addition
- `add_glp.py` - Compact file addition script
- `create_padded_icon.swift` - Icon generation with padding

### Asset Management
**Critical Discovery**: iOS looks for assets in `Resources/Assets.xcassets/`, NOT root-level `Assets.xcassets/`

### Animation Timing Formula
```swift
// Rotation speed = duration per 360° rotation
.linear(duration: 1.6) // 1.6s per full rotation (slow)

// Phase timing
Phase 1: 0-1.0s (spinning)
Phase 2: 1.0-2.0s (stabilize + text)
Phase 3: 2.0-2.5s (fade out)
```
