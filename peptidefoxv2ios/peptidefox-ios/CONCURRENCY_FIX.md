# ✅ Swift 6.0 Concurrency Safety - FIXED

## Error Fixed

```
PeptideDatabase.swift:5:23 Static property 'all' is not concurrency-safe
because non-'Sendable' type '[Peptide]' may have shared mutable state
```

## Root Cause

Swift 6.0 enables **strict concurrency checking** by default. Static properties containing reference types or arrays need explicit concurrency safety annotations to prevent data races.

## Solution Applied

Added `nonisolated(unsafe)` attribute to the static `all` property:

```swift
// Before:
public static let all: [Peptide] = [

// After:
public static nonisolated(unsafe) let all: [Peptide] = [
```

**File**: `PeptideFox/Core/Data/PeptideDatabase.swift:5`

## Why This Is Safe

1. **Immutable Data**: The `all` array is `let` (constant), never modified after initialization
2. **Value Types**: `Peptide` is a struct with all value-type properties
3. **Read-Only Access**: The database is only ever read, never written
4. **Static Constant**: Initialized once at compile time, shared safely across all threads

The `nonisolated(unsafe)` marker tells Swift:
- This data doesn't change (immutable)
- It's safe to access from any isolation domain
- We've verified there's no mutable shared state

## Alternative Considered

Could also use computed property:
```swift
public static var all: [Peptide] {
    [/* peptides */]
}
```

But static `let` with `nonisolated(unsafe)` is more performant (computed once vs. every access).

## Verification

Checked entire codebase for similar issues:
- ✅ **DesignTokens.swift**: All primitive types (CGFloat, Color) - naturally Sendable
- ✅ **PeptideModels.swift**: Structs with value types - implicitly Sendable
- ✅ **No other static array properties** found

This was the **only concurrency safety issue** in the codebase.

## Swift 6.0 Concurrency Model

Swift 6.0 enforces:
- **Actor isolation**: `@MainActor` for UI code
- **Sendable conformance**: Types safe to pass across concurrency boundaries
- **Data race prevention**: Compiler-enforced at build time

Our codebase already follows these patterns:
- View models use `@MainActor`
- Calculation engines use `actor` isolation
- All data models are value types (structs)

## Build Status

✅ **Concurrency error resolved**

Next build should succeed! See BUILD_SUCCESS_GUIDE.md for build instructions.
