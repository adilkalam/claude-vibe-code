## 📋 Immediate Action Items (Do This Week)

### Priority 1: Add Privacy Manifest to Xcode (5 minutes)
```
1. Open PeptideFox.xcodeproj in Xcode
2. Drag PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy into project navigator
3. Check "PeptideFox" target membership
4. Build (Cmd+B) to verify
```

### Priority 2: Create App Icon (30 minutes)
**Quick Placeholder** (for testing):
```
1. Create 1024x1024 image with blue background (#007AFF)
2. Add white "PF" text in center (or use fox icon)
3. Save as icon-1024.png
4. Place in: Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/
```

See: `APP_ICON_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for detailed guide

### Priority 3: Set Up Navigation (1-2 hours)
Update `PeptideFoxApp.swift`:
```swift
@main
struct PeptideFoxApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            TabView {
                GLPJourneyView()
                    .tabItem { Label("GLP-1", systemImage: "chart.line.uptrend.xyaxis") }
                
                // TODO: Add calculator, planner, library
                
                AboutView()
                    .tabItem { Label("About", systemImage: "info.circle") }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
