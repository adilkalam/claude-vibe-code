# Paul Graham Writing Style - Core Patterns

**Source**: Analysis of 25 essays across writing, technical, long-form, and short-form content

---

## 1. Sentence Structure & Rhythm

### The Pattern
**Varied length for emphasis, not decoration**

- **Short sentences** (3-7 words): Establish key claims, create impact
  - "A startup is a company designed to grow fast."
  - "It is, of course."
  - "Problems exist."

- **Medium sentences** (10-20 words): Build arguments, connect ideas
  - Dominant sentence type
  - Maintain flow without losing clarity

- **Long sentences** (20+ words): Develop complex ideas, show relationships
  - Used sparingly
  - Broken by punctuation for digestibility

### The Principle
**Rhythm comes from alternation, not regularity**
- Don't write all sentences the same length
- Use short sentences AFTER long ones for maximum impact
- Fragments are allowed when they emphasize ("Not anymore.")

---

## 2. Word Choice

### The Pattern
**Simple, concrete, active**

- **Prefer Germanic/Anglo-Saxon over Latinate**
  - "use" not "utilize"
  - "help" not "facilitate"
  - "show" not "demonstrate"

- **Concrete over abstract**
  - "glitter," "scrape," "prim" over "aesthetically pleasing"
  - Physical metaphors: "shaking bins," "car spinning wheels," "gravitational field"

- **Active verbs over passive constructions**
  - "Founders make startups take off" not "Startups are grown by founders"

- **Avoid jargon unless necessary**
  - When technical terms needed, ground them in examples immediately

### The Principle
**If a simpler word works, use it**
- Fancy words feel clumsy, not sophisticated
- Clarity > impressiveness

---

## 3. Tone & Voice

### The Pattern
**Conversational authority**

- **Use "I" and "you" freely**
  - "I try," "I'm not saying," "I bet you do too"
  - Makes writing feel like dialogue, not lecture

- **Admit uncertainty when genuine**
  - "I may be wrong"
  - "I don't know enough to say"
  - "I only really figured it out as I was writing this"
  - **Effect**: Builds credibility through honesty

- **Self-deprecating when appropriate**
  - "I'm a little embarrassed to say"
  - "I say 'um' a lot"
  - Humanizes the writer

- **Think-aloud quality**
  - Show reasoning process, not just conclusions
  - "It struck me recently..."
  - "I finally realized..."

### The Principle
**Write like you talk to smart friends**
- Approachable but not dumbed down
- Personal but not chatty
- Confident but not arrogant

---

## 4. Paragraph Structure

### The Pattern
**Short, focused paragraphs**

- **Typical length**: 2-5 sentences
- **Rarely exceed**: 6-7 sentences
- **Single idea per paragraph**

### Paragraph Opening Strategies
1. **Topic sentence** (most common)
2. **Provocative question**
3. **Contrasting claim**
4. **Concrete example**

### The Principle
**White space creates readability**
- Long paragraphs feel dense and academic
- Short paragraphs invite reading
- Break when shifting ideas, not just when "long enough"

---

## 5. Examples & Evidence

### The Pattern
**Ground abstractions in specifics**

- **Personal anecdotes**
  - The Baskin-Robbins ice cream story
  - Collison brothers saying "Give me your laptop"
  - Walking in Palo Alto
  - **Effect**: Builds credibility through lived experience

- **Historical references**
  - Einstein, Newton, Shakespeare, Montaigne
  - **Effect**: Shows patterns across time/domains

- **Hypotheticals**
  - "Imagine if..."
  - "What if you..."
  - **Effect**: Invites reader participation

- **Concrete companies/people**
  - Stripe, Airbnb, Facebook
  - Specific names, specific details
  - **Effect**: Makes theoretical practical

### The Principle
**Examples are proof, not decoration**
- Don't just assert—demonstrate
- Specificity > vagueness
- "The Collison brothers" > "some founders"

---

## 6. Conversational Elements

### The Pattern
**Dialogue with the reader**

#### Rhetorical Questions
- "Why is it so important to work on a problem you have?"
- "Is that so bad?"
- "What are your abilities?"
- **Effect**: Engages critical thinking, anticipates objections

#### Direct Address
- "You don't have to..."
- "You might think..."
- "If you want to know..."
- **Effect**: Creates intimacy, makes advice feel personal

#### Parenthetical Asides
- "(which is why...)"
- "(I'm sometimes accused of meandering)"
- "(b) if you add that final increment..."
- **Effect**: Feels like spoken conversation, adds personality

#### Acknowledge Counterarguments
- "You might also want to remember..."
- "There are exceptions, of course..."
- "I'm not saying..."
- **Effect**: Shows intellectual honesty, disarms skeptics

### The Principle
**Anticipate objections and address them directly**
- Don't pretend your argument is airtight
- Show your reasoning, including doubts

---

## 7. Structural Patterns

### Common Essay Arcs

**1. Observation → Analysis → Implication**
- Start with something noticed
- Explore why it matters
- End with what to do

**2. Problem → Examples → Solution**
- Identify the issue
- Show it in action
- Propose fix

**3. Claim → Objections → Refinement**
- Make assertion
- Address skepticism
- Strengthen position

### Section Headers
- Bold, simple phrases
- Mark major conceptual shifts
- Allow skimming and deep reading

## 8. Editing Principles (from PG's own essays on writing)

### Graham's Process
1. **Draft fast** - "Write the first version fast"
2. **Cut ruthlessly** - "Rewrite to make things clearer and more concise"
3. **Read aloud** - Catch awkward phrasing
4. **Test for deletability** - If a sentence can be removed without loss, remove it

### Key Rules
- **Start with the crucial sentence** - "Figure out the most important sentence first"
- **Delete unnecessary words** - "Use fewer, simpler words"
- **Avoid qualifications** - Don't hedge unless genuinely uncertain
- **Cut introductions** - Start with the interesting part
- **Use simple structure** - Fancy words = clumsy

---

## 9. What to Avoid

Based on what PG explicitly rejects:

❌ **Formal/stuffy language**
- "utilized" → use
- "pen" as verb → write
- "mercurial Spaniard" → just say what you mean

❌ **Unnecessary complexity**
- Long word when short word works
- Passive voice when active is clearer
- Subordinate clauses when simple sentences work

❌ **Vagueness**
- "some people" → name them
- "often" → when?
- "important" → why?

❌ **Hedging (unless genuine)**
- "It could be argued that..." → just argue it
- "Some might say..." → do you agree or not?

❌ **Academic pomposity**
- Jargon for jargon's sake
- Citations as decoration
- Complexity as sophistication signal

## 10. The Meta-Pattern

### What Makes PG's Style Work

**Clarity through simplicity**
- Not dumbed down—simplified
- Accessible to smart people without expertise

**Authority through honesty**
- Admits uncertainty
- Shows reasoning
- Invites skepticism

**Engagement through conversation**
- Writes like he talks
- Addresses reader directly
- Thinks aloud

**Memorability through specifics**
- Concrete examples
- Vivid metaphors
- Personal stories

## Summary: The PG Style Checklist

Before publishing, ask:

1. ✅ **Sentence variety?** (short, medium, long - not all same)
2. ✅ **Simple words?** (Germanic > Latinate, concrete > abstract)
3. ✅ **Conversational tone?** ("I," "you," casual phrases)
4. ✅ **Short paragraphs?** (2-5 sentences typical)
5. ✅ **Specific examples?** (names, details, stories)
6. ✅ **Anticipate objections?** (address counterarguments)
7. ✅ **Cut unnecessary words?** (every sentence earns its place)
8. ✅ **Read like you talk?** (sounds natural when read aloud)
