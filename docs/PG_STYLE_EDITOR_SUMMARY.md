## The 10 Core PG Principles

1. **Sentence Rhythm**: Varied length for emphasis (short after long = impact)
2. **Word Choice**: Simple, concrete, active (Germanic > Latinate)
3. **Tone**: Conversational authority (write like you talk to smart friends)
4. **Paragraphs**: Short and focused (2-5 sentences typically)
5. **Examples**: Specific, not vague (Stripe, not "some company")
6. **Conversational Elements**: Engage the reader (questions, asides, "you")
7. **Structure**: Logical arc (observation → analysis → implication)
8. **Editing**: Cut ruthlessly (every word earns its place)
9. **What to Avoid**: Formal language, complexity, vagueness, hedging
10. **Meta-Pattern**: Clarity + authority + engagement + memorability

## Example Transformation

### Before (47 words of corporate-speak):
```
The implementation of our strategic initiative necessitates the utilization
of advanced technological solutions to facilitate optimization of operational
efficiency. This will enable us to enhance our competitive positioning in the
marketplace and drive sustainable growth trajectories.
```

### After (44 words, PG style):
```
We need better software. Right now our team wastes half their time on manual
work that could be automated.

The fix: build internal tools that do the boring stuff. When Stripe did this,
they cut deployment time from hours to minutes. Engineers shipped features 10x faster.

What's stopping us? Nothing. We start next week.
```

### What Changed:
- ✅ Varied sentence rhythm (4 to 13 words)
- ✅ Simple words ("need" not "utilize")
- ✅ Conversational tone ("we," "What's stopping us?")
- ✅ 3 short paragraphs
- ✅ Specific example (Stripe, 10x metric)
- ✅ Unnecessary words cut
- ✅ Reads like speech

## Why This Works

Paul Graham's style is:
- **Clear** through simplicity (not dumbed down—simplified)
- **Authoritative** through honesty (admits uncertainty, shows reasoning)
- **Engaging** through conversation (writes like he talks)
- **Memorable** through specifics (concrete examples, vivid metaphors)

The skill applies these patterns systematically.
