## The 10 Core PG Principles

1. **Sentence Rhythm**: Varied length for emphasis (short after long = impact)
2. **Word Choice**: Simple, concrete, active (Germanic > Latinate)
3. **Tone**: Conversational authority (write like you talk to smart friends)
4. **Paragraphs**: Short and focused (2-5 sentences typically)
5. **Examples**: Specific, not vague (Stripe, not "some company")
6. **Conversational Elements**: Engage the reader (questions, asides, "you")
7. **Structure**: Logical arc (observation → analysis → implication)
8. **Editing**: Cut ruthlessly (every word earns its place)
9. **What to Avoid**: Formal language, complexity, vagueness, hedging
10. **Meta-Pattern**: Clarity + authority + engagement + memorability

## How to Use

### Activate the Skill

Once Claude Code loads skills (on next session):

```
Use the pg-style-editor skill to rewrite this:

[paste your content]
```

Or trigger with keywords:
- "Make this clearer"
- "Simplify this"
- "Rewrite in Paul Graham's style"
- "Edit this to be more conversational"

### What It Does

1. **Analyzes** your content against 8 PG criteria
2. **Rewrites** using PG principles
3. **Shows** before/after comparison
4. **Explains** what changed and why
5. **Provides** checklist verification

## Example Transformation

### Before (47 words of corporate-speak):
```
The implementation of our strategic initiative necessitates the utilization
of advanced technological solutions to facilitate optimization of operational
efficiency. This will enable us to enhance our competitive positioning in the
marketplace and drive sustainable growth trajectories.
```

### After (44 words, PG style):
```
We need better software. Right now our team wastes half their time on manual
work that could be automated.

The fix: build internal tools that do the boring stuff. When Stripe did this,
they cut deployment time from hours to minutes. Engineers shipped features 10x faster.

What's stopping us? Nothing. We start next week.
```

### What Changed:
- ✅ Varied sentence rhythm (4 to 13 words)
- ✅ Simple words ("need" not "utilize")
- ✅ Conversational tone ("we," "What's stopping us?")
- ✅ 3 short paragraphs
- ✅ Specific example (Stripe, 10x metric)
- ✅ Unnecessary words cut
- ✅ Reads like speech

## Why This Works

Paul Graham's style is:
- **Clear** through simplicity (not dumbed down—simplified)
- **Authoritative** through honesty (admits uncertainty, shows reasoning)
- **Engaging** through conversation (writes like he talks)
- **Memorable** through specifics (concrete examples, vivid metaphors)

The skill applies these patterns systematically.

# PG Style Editor V2 - Research Focus Updates

**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Purpose**: Updated skill for long-form research writing without first-person voice

---

## What Changed

### 1. Added 10 More Long-Form Essays

**New Essays Analyzed**:
1. The Origins of Wokeness
2. Superlinear Returns
3. How to Get New Ideas
4. The Four Quadrants of Conformism
5. Modeling a Wealth Tax
6. Economic Inequality
7. The Bus Ticket Theory of Genius
8. A Unified Theory of VC Suckage
9. How to Make Wealth
10. How to Raise Money

**Total**: 35 essays analyzed (25 original + 10 long-form)

### 2. Removed First-Person Requirement

**Old Principle #3 (Conversational)**:
```
Tone: Conversational Authority
- Use "I" and "you" freely
- Admit uncertainty: "I may be wrong"
- Self-deprecating: "I only figured this out recently"
- Think-aloud quality: "It struck me that..."
```

**New Principle #3 (Research)**:
```
Tone: Accessible Formality
- Objective statements instead of first-person
- Clear assertions without false hedging
- Acknowledge complexity when genuine
  - "The evidence remains inconclusive"
  - "This model represents the most optimistic case"
- Guide thinking with questions
  - "What's going on here?"
  - "Why there? And why then?"
```

### 3. Updated for Research Writing

#### Paragraph Length
- **Old**: 2-5 sentences typical
- **New**: 3-6 sentences typical, up to 10 for complex arguments

#### Evidence Types
Added research-specific evidence categories:
1. Historical examples (named people, companies, events)
2. Numerical data (specific metrics, percentages, timelines)
3. Systematic patterns (multiple cases showing trend)
4. Thought experiments (grounded hypotheticals)

#### Structure Elements
Added long-form elements:
- Section headers
- Numbered lists for systematic analysis
- Tables/data for scanability
- Transitional paragraphs
- Footnotes for scholarly rigor

### 4. Updated Example

**Old Example (Conversational)**:
```
We need better software to work faster. This means building tools that let our
team ship features in days, not months. When Stripe did this, they went from
"someday" to profitable in two years.
```

**New Example (Research)**:
```
Organizations face a recurring problem: manual processes consume resources
better spent on core work. Software automation addresses this directly. When
Stripe automated deployment, release time dropped from hours to minutes.
Engineers shipped features 10x faster. The pattern holds across industries.
```

**Key differences**:
- No "we/our" → "Organizations"
- No first-person → objective statements
- Concrete metrics → "10x faster", "hours to minutes"
- Pattern generalization → "holds across industries"
