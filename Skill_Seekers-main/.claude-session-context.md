# Session Context - 2025-10-21

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-21
**Session Focus:** Orchestration system setup - Aggressive review gate implementation

---

## What We Accomplished

**Critical Fix:** Added aggressive review gate to `/orca` command to prevent "deliver 1/8 items and claim done" pattern.

**Problem Identified:**
- Built aggressive review gate in `/agentfeedback` for iterations
- BUT fresh iOS starts use `/orca` which didn't have it
- Same failure pattern would happen again

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added Phase 6: Aggressive Review Gate to `/orca`
- BEFORE/AFTER screenshot capture
- Line-by-line promise verification
- Blocking decision if <95% complete
- Concrete violations checklist integration

**Files Modified:**
- `~/.claude/commands/orca.md` - Added Phase 6 with full review gate
- Updated workflow: Phase 5 (Verification) → Phase 6 (Review Gate) → Phase 7 (Final Approval)

## System Now Protected

**Both entry points have aggressive review gates:**

1. **`/orca`** (fresh starts)
   - Tech stack detection
   - Agent team orchestration
   - Verification requirements
   - ✅ **NEW: Aggressive review gate**
   - Quality gates

2. **`/agentfeedback`** (iterations)
   - Design understanding gate
   - Platform detection
   - ✅ Aggressive review gate
   - `--learn` flag for rule extraction

## Fresh iOS Start Ready

**Prepared for clean iOS build:**
- Location: `/Users/adilkalam/Desktop/OBDN/peptidefox-ios-clean/`
- Assets packaged: LoadingView.swift + peptidefoxicon.png
- Web project cleaned of iOS references
- Both orchestration commands protected with review gates

**To start:**
```
/orca Build calculator view for iOS app
```

Review gate will prevent incomplete delivery at both:
- Fresh starts (via /orca)
- Iterations (via /agentfeedback)

## Key Files & Locations

**Orchestration Commands:**
- `~/.claude/commands/orca.md` - Fresh project starts
- `~/.claude/commands/agentfeedback.md` - Feedback iterations

**Documentation:**
- `~/claude-vibe-code/docs/CONCRETE_VIOLATIONS_CHECKLIST.md` - 23 observable checks
- `~/claude-vibe-code/docs/PLATFORM_AWARE_ORCHESTRATION.md` - Platform detection
- `~/claude-vibe-code/docs/DESIGN_UNDERSTANDING_GATE.md` - Understanding + review gates

**iOS Clean Start:**
- `/Users/adilkalam/Desktop/OBDN/peptidefox-ios-clean/assets/` - Loading animation

## Next Session

When you're ready to start fresh iOS build:
1. Open clean folder in Claude Code
2. Run `/orca Build calculator view for iOS app`
3. Aggressive review gate will verify 100% completion before presentation
