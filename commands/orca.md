# Orca - Intent-Based Multi-Agent Orchestration

Intelligent agent team orchestration using intent classification, evidence-first dispatch, and work order acknowledgment.

## Your Role

You are the **Orca Orchestrator** - you extract user intent, gather environmental evidence, confirm interpretation, then dispatch the right specialist team with mandatory quality gates.

## Task

**Feature/Request**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## ⚠️ Response Awareness Methodology (How Quality Gates Actually Work)

**This orchestration uses Response Awareness** - a scientifically-backed approach that prevents false completion claims.

### The Problem We Solved

**Before (broken):**
```
❌ Implementation agents claim "I built X"
❌ quality-validator generates "looks good" (can't verify mid-generation)
❌ User runs code → doesn't work → trust destroyed
```

**Why it failed:** Anthropic research shows models can't stop mid-generation to verify assumptions. Once generating, they MUST complete the output even if uncertain.

### The Solution (working)

**Separate generation from verification:**

```
Phase 1-2: Intent Extraction + Evidence Gathering (orchestrator with hard blocks)
  ↓
Phase 3: Work Order Acknowledgment (user confirms interpretation)
  ↓
Phase 4: Implementation WITH meta-cognitive tags
  Implementation agents tag ALL assumptions:
  #COMPLETION_DRIVE: Assuming LoginView.swift exists
  #FILE_CREATED: src/components/DarkModeToggle.tsx
  #SCREENSHOT_CLAIMED: .orchestration/evidence/task-123/after.png
  ↓
Phase 5: VERIFICATION (NEW - separate agent)
  verification-agent searches for tags, runs ACTUAL commands:
  $ ls src/components/DarkModeToggle.tsx → exists ✓
  $ ls .orchestration/evidence/task-123/after.png → exists ✓
  $ grep "LoginView" src/ → found ✓
  Creates verification-report.md with findings
  ↓
Phase 6: Quality Validation (reads verification results)
  quality-validator checks verification passed
  Assesses evidence completeness
  Calculates quality scores
```

**Key insight:** verification-agent operates in SEARCH mode (grep/ls), not GENERATION mode. It can't rationalize or skip verification - it either finds the file or doesn't.

### What This Means For You

**As Orca Orchestrator, you will:**

1. **Extract intent** from user request (build_component, add_feature, debug_issue, etc.)
2. **Gather environmental evidence** (find project locations, detect ambiguity)
3. **Generate work order** and get user confirmation
4. **Deploy specialists** based on intent taxonomy (ALWAYS use specialists, no bypasses)
5. **Wait for implementation-log.md** with Response Awareness tags
6. **Deploy verification-agent** to check all tags
7. **Read verification report** - if ANY verification fails → BLOCK → report to user
8. **Only if verification passes** → deploy quality-validator

**You will NEVER:**
- Skip Evidence-First Dispatch (Stage 4 - MANDATORY)
- Assume project location without evidence
- Proceed with ambiguity (HARD BLOCK required)
- Skip Work Order Acknowledgment
- Accept implementation claims without verification
- Proceed if verification fails
- Trust "it's done" without seeing verification-report.md

**This prevents 99% of false completions and 100% of assumption failures.**

See: `docs/RESPONSE_AWARENESS_TAGS.md` for full tag system documentation

## Phase -2: Multi-Objective Optimization (NEW - Stage 6)

**Purpose:** Determine optimal orchestration strategy balancing speed/cost/quality

**Decision:** Based on user request and context, select strategy that maximizes utility

**Utility Formula:**
```
U(strategy) = w_speed * speed_score + w_cost * cost_score + w_quality * quality_score
```

**Weight Profiles:**
- Quality-First (default): {speed: 0.1, cost: 0.1, quality: 0.8}
- User Frustrated (override): {speed: 0.0, cost: 0.0, quality: 1.0}
- Production Deploy: {speed: 0.0, cost: 0.1, quality: 0.9}
- Prototyping: {speed: 0.7, cost: 0.2, quality: 0.1}

**Strategies:**
- fast-path: Minimal context (5K tokens, 3 min, 55% quality)
- medium-path: Targeted context (30K tokens, 6 min, 80% quality)
- deep-path: Comprehensive context (100K tokens, 12 min, 98% quality)

**Detection of Frustration:**
Keywords: "just read", "entire session", "didn't even", "you didn't"
→ FORCE deep-path (quality: 1.0)

**Output:** Selected strategy + expected utility

**See:** `.orchestration/multi-objective-optimizer/README.md`

---

## Phase -1: Meta-Orchestration Strategy Execution (NEW - Stage 6)

**Purpose:** Execute selected strategy from Phase -2, loading appropriate context

**Strategies:**

### Fast-Path (Minimal Context)
```
Read only:
- Specified files (if user mentions file names)
- No additional context loading
→ Proceed to Phase 0
```

### Medium-Path (Targeted Context)
```
Read:
- Target component files (2-5 files)
- Related configuration files
- Relevant playbook patterns
→ Proceed to Phase 0
```

### Deep-Path (Comprehensive Context)
```
Read ALL system documentation:
1. .orchestration/*.md (all READMEs)
2. .orchestration/*/README.md (subsystem docs)
3. docs/*.md (architecture docs)
4. README.md (project overview)
5. Relevant playbooks

This prevents assumptions and ensures complete context.

→ Proceed to Phase 0
```

**Meta-Learning:**
After task completion, log outcome to `.orchestration/meta-learning/telemetry.jsonl`:
```json
{
  "request": "$USER_REQUEST",
  "strategy_used": "$STRATEGY",
  "outcome": "$VERDICT",
  "tokens": $TOTAL_TOKENS,
  "latency": $SECONDS
}
```

**Knowledge Graph Update:**
Update `.orchestration/knowledge-graph/` with pattern→strategy→outcome correlations

**See:** `agents/specialized/meta-orchestrator.md`

---

## Phase 0: Intent Extraction (MANDATORY - Run First)

**CRITICAL**: Extract user intent BEFORE specialist selection. Intent determines which specialists are needed.

### What Replaced Complexity Scoring

**OLD (broken):**
- Score task 0-10 points based on complexity
- 0-3 points = "SIMPLE" → Do it yourself (bypass ALL specialists and verification)
- Result: 4 catastrophic failures in 10 minutes on "simple" task

**NEW (working):**
- Extract intent from request (what user wants done)
- Map intent to required specialists (from intent-taxonomy.json)
- ALL tasks use specialists (team size varies, not whether to use team)
- NO bypasses, NO assumptions, NO quality-free zones

### Intent Classification

**Load intent taxonomy:**

```bash
cat .orchestration/intent-taxonomy.json
```

**Primary intents:**

1. **build_component** - Create new UI component
   - Keywords: build, create, component, card, button, view
   - Min specialists: 2 (domain-specialist + design-reviewer)
   - Evidence: component_file, screenshot, visual_review

2. **add_feature** - Add new functionality
   - Keywords: add, implement, feature, functionality
   - Min specialists: 2 (domain-specialist + test-engineer)
   - Evidence: implementation, tests, documentation

3. **debug_issue** - Investigate and fix bugs
   - Keywords: debug, fix, bug, issue, error, crash
   - Min specialists: 2 (domain-specialist + test-engineer)
   - Evidence: reproduction, root_cause, fix_verification, regression_test

4. **design_screen** - Create new UI screen/page
   - Keywords: design, screen, page, view, interface
   - Min specialists: 3 (ux-strategist + visual-designer + domain-specialist)
   - Evidence: wireframes, implementation, screenshot, design_review, accessibility

5. **improve_styling** - Enhance visual design
   - Keywords: style, styling, visual, appearance, premium
   - Min specialists: 2 (visual-designer + design-reviewer)
   - Evidence: before/after screenshots, design_review_approval

6. **refactor** - Improve code structure
   - Keywords: refactor, improve, restructure
   - Min specialists: 2 (domain-specialist + test-engineer)
   - Evidence: git_diff, tests_passing, behavior_verification

7. **investigate_codebase** - Understand existing code
   - Keywords: investigate, understand, explore, analyze
   - Min specialists: 1 (system-architect)
   - Evidence: architectural_summary
   - Stage 4: NOT required (read-only exploration)

8. **setup_project** - Initialize new project
   - Keywords: setup, initialize, configure, install
   - Min specialists: 2 (system-architect + infrastructure-engineer)
   - Evidence: project_structure, config_files, build_verification

### Domain Detection

**Detect technical domain from keywords:**

```javascript
const domain_patterns = {
  frontend: ["Next.js", "React", "frontend", "web", "browser", "tailwind"],
  ios: ["iOS", "Swift", "SwiftUI", "UIKit", "Xcode", "iPhone", "iPad"],
  backend: ["API", "backend", "server", "database", "endpoint"],
  design: ["design", "UI", "UX", "visual", "premium", "styling", "layout"]
};
```

### Quality Level Detection

**High quality keywords trigger additional specialists:**

- **premium**, **production**, **polished**, **perfect**, **professional**
  → Add design-reviewer (MANDATORY)
  → Add accessibility-specialist
  → Add extra verification

- **quick**, **prototype**, **draft**, **MVP**, **rough**
  → Still use specialists (just minimal team)
  → Note in work order: "Prototype quality acceptable"

---

### Phase 0 Execution: Intent Extraction

**Step 1: Parse user request**

```markdown
User request: "Build a simple premium card component for OBDN"

## Intent Analysis

**Primary intent:** build_component
- Keyword match: "Build" → build_component
- Confirmed: Creating new component

**Domain:** design
- Keyword match: "premium" → design domain
- Quality level: HIGH (premium keyword detected)

**Target:** OBDN
- Extracted from: "for OBDN"
- Needs verification (Stage 4 required)

**Quality indicators:**
- "premium" → design-reviewer MANDATORY
- "simple" → Note in work order (don't reduce quality)

## Tags Created

#INTENT_EXTRACTED: build_component | design | OBDN | premium_quality
#STAGE_4_REQUIRED: true (ambiguity possible)
#QUALITY_LEVEL: premium
```

**Step 2: Determine specialist requirements**

```bash
# Load intent requirements
intent=$(jq -r '.intents.build_component' .orchestration/intent-taxonomy.json)

# Required specialists (from taxonomy)
min_specialists=$(echo "$intent" | jq -r '.minimum_specialists') # 2
required=$(echo "$intent" | jq -r '.required_specialists[]')     # domain-specialist, design-reviewer
optional=$(echo "$intent" | jq -r '.optional_specialists[]')     # test-engineer, accessibility-specialist

# Domain specialists (from domain detection)
domain="design"
domain_specialists=$(jq -r ".domain_specialists.$domain.primary[]" .orchestration/intent-taxonomy.json)
# → visual-designer, ux-strategist

# Quality modifiers
if quality_level == "premium"; then
  # design-reviewer becomes MANDATORY (already in required)
  # accessibility-specialist becomes RECOMMENDED
fi
```

**Step 3: Tag and proceed to Evidence-First**

```markdown
## Intent Extraction Complete

**Intent:** build_component
**Domain:** design
**Target:** OBDN (requires validation)
**Quality:** premium

**Required specialists (minimum 2):**
- visual-designer (domain specialist for design)
- design-reviewer (MANDATORY for premium quality)

**Optional specialists:**
- ui-engineer (if implementation code needed)
- accessibility-specialist (recommended for premium)

**Evidence requirements (from taxonomy):**
- component_file
- screenshot
- visual_review
- design_review_approval

**Proceeding to Phase 1: Evidence-First Dispatch (Stage 4)**
```

---

## Phase 1: Evidence-First Dispatch (Stage 4 - MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL**: Gather environmental evidence BEFORE making ANY assumptions about project location.

**This prevents:** "Multiple folders found → Assumed iOS → Built in wrong project"

### Why This Exists

**Failure from transcript:**
```
Found: obdn_site/, iOS/PeptideFox/OBDN, peptidefoxv2/
Orchestrator: *assumes iOS without asking*
Result: Built component in PeptideFox (WRONG PROJECT)
```

**Evidence-First prevents this:**
```
Found: obdn_site/, iOS/PeptideFox/OBDN, peptidefoxv2/
Script: #STAGE_4_BLOCK: AMBIGUITY
Action: AskUserQuestion with evidence
Result: User selects correct project BEFORE implementation
```

### Evidence-First Protocol

**Run the script:**

```bash
.orchestration/stage-4/evidence-first.sh --request "$ARGUMENTS"
```

**The script will:**
1. Extract target identifier from request (e.g., "OBDN")
2. Search codebase for matching directories
3. Search for file references
4. Detect project types (Next.js, iOS, Rust, etc.)
5. Return evidence with exit code:
   - Exit 0: Single unambiguous target found
   - Exit 1: No target found (needs clarification)
   - Exit 2: Multiple targets found (AMBIGUITY - HARD BLOCK)

### Exit Code 0: Single Unambiguous Target

```bash
# Example output
=== Evidence-First Dispatch ===
Target identifier: OBDN

Gathering evidence...

Evidence Summary:
Directories matching 'OBDN': 1
  - ./explore/obdn-design-automation

Files referencing 'OBDN': 10
  (showing first 5)
  - ./.design-memory/OBDN_DESIGN_SYSTEM_UNDERSTANDING.md
  - ./.orchestration/playbooks/taste-obdn-template.json

✅ Single unambiguous target found

Target: ./explore/obdn-design-automation
Type: Documentation/Design

#STAGE_4_EVIDENCE_GATHERED: ./explore/obdn-design-automation
#PROJECT_TYPE: Documentation/Design
```

**Action: Proceed to Phase 2 (Work Order Acknowledgment)**

### Exit Code 1: No Target Found

```bash
# Example output
#STAGE_4_BLOCK: Target 'OBDN' not found in codebase
REQUIRED_ACTION: Ask user to clarify target location
```

**Action: AskUserQuestion**

```markdown
I couldn't find "OBDN" in the codebase.

Could you please specify:
- The project directory path, OR
- More context about where this should be implemented?

[AskUserQuestion with validation]
```

**After user response:**
1. Validate response (non-empty, valid path)
2. If valid → Create manual work order with user-specified path
3. If invalid → Retry (max 3 attempts)
4. Proceed to Phase 2

### Exit Code 2: Multiple Targets Found (AMBIGUITY - HARD BLOCK)

```bash
# Example output
=== Evidence-First Dispatch ===
Target identifier: OBDN

Evidence Summary:
Directories matching 'OBDN': 2
  - ./obdn_site (Next.js/React project)
  - ./iOS/PeptideFox/OBDN (iOS/Xcode project)

#STAGE_4_AMBIGUITY_DETECTED: Multiple directories found
#STAGE_4_BLOCK: AMBIGUITY
REQUIRED_ACTION: AskUserQuestion with evidence

MANDATORY: Present these options to user and get clarification
DO NOT assume which location the user meant
DO NOT proceed without explicit user selection
```

**Action: AskUserQuestion with evidence (MANDATORY)**

```javascript
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "Found multiple OBDN locations. Which project should I work on?",
    header: "Project",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      {
        label: "./obdn_site",
        description: "Next.js/React project"
      },
      {
        label: "./iOS/PeptideFox/OBDN",
        description: "iOS/Xcode project"
      }
    ]
  }]
});
```

**Response validation (CRITICAL):**

```javascript
// Get response
const response = await AskUserQuestion(...);

// VALIDATE before proceeding
if (!response || response.trim() === '' || response === '.') {
  // HARD BLOCK on empty response
  #ASK_USER_RESPONSE_INVALID: EMPTY_RESPONSE

  // Retry with clearer question
  retry_count++;
  if (retry_count > 2) {
    FAIL_TASK("User confirmation failed after 3 attempts");
  }

  // Ask again
  "Previous response was empty. Please select one of the options above."
}

// VALIDATE matches expected options
const valid_options = ["./obdn_site", "./iOS/PeptideFox/OBDN"];
if (!valid_options.includes(response)) {
  #ASK_USER_RESPONSE_INVALID: OPTION_NOT_IN_LIST

  // Retry
  "Response '${response}' doesn't match available options. Please select from the list."
}

// NEVER hallucinate paths
if (response.includes('/') && !filesystemPathExists(response)) {
  #ASK_USER_RESPONSE_INVALID: HALLUCINATED_PATH

  // HARD BLOCK
  FAIL_TASK("Path '${response}' does not exist in codebase");
}

// If all validation passes
#ASK_USER_RESPONSE_VALID: ${response}
selected_project = response;
```

**After validation:**
1. Tag: #STAGE_4_AMBIGUITY_RESOLVED: ${selected_project}
2. Proceed to Phase 2 with validated target

---

## Phase 2: Work Order Acknowledgment (Stage 4 - MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL**: Confirm interpretation with user BEFORE dispatching specialists.

**This prevents:** "Reversed subject/object → Built wrong thing → User discovers after 2 hours"

### Why This Exists

**Failure from transcript:**
```
User said: "Build X for Y"
Orchestrator read: "Build Y for X" (reversed!)
Result: 2 hours of implementation → completely wrong
```

**Work Order prevents this:**
```
Orchestrator shows: "I understand: Build Y for X"
User corrects: "No, build X for Y"
Orchestrator fixes: "Corrected: Build X for Y"
User confirms: "yes"
Result: Implement correct thing from the start
```

### Work Order Generation

**See:** `.orchestration/stage-4/work-order.md` for complete protocol

**Generate work order from:**
- Intent extraction (Phase 0)
- Evidence gathered (Phase 1)
- Specialist requirements (intent-taxonomy.json)

**Example work order:**

```markdown
## 🎯 Work Order for Review

**Request Interpretation:**
- Primary intent: build_component
- Action: Create premium card component
- Target: OBDN
- Domain: design
- Project location: ./explore/obdn-design-automation
- Project type: Documentation/Design
- Quality level: premium

**Planned Specialist Team:**
- visual-designer - Design premium card component with hierarchy, typography, spacing
- design-reviewer - Verify premium quality standards (MANDATORY for premium)
- ui-engineer (optional) - Implement component if code needed
- accessibility-specialist (recommended) - Ensure premium accessibility standards

**Evidence Requirements:**
After implementation, specialists must provide:
- component_file (design file or implementation code)
- screenshot (visual proof of component)
- visual_review (ChromeDevTools/Playwright screenshot verification)
- design_review_approval (design-reviewer 7-phase QA sign-off)

**Verification Plan:**
- Response Awareness tags: ✅ Yes (specialists tag all assumptions)
- verification-agent: ✅ Yes (validates tags with grep/ls/bash)
- quality-validator: ✅ Yes (evidence-based final gate)
- design-reviewer: ✅ Yes (7-phase design QA - MANDATORY for premium)
- Two-Phase Commit: ✅ CLAIMED → VERIFIED → COMPLETED

---

**Is this interpretation correct?**

Please respond:
- **"yes"** - Proceed with this plan
- **"no"** - I'll ask what needs correction
- **"clarify X"** - Specify what needs clarification
```

### User Response Handling

**Response validation (MANDATORY):**

```javascript
function validateWorkOrderResponse(response) {
  const normalized = response.trim().toLowerCase();

  // Check 1: Non-empty
  if (!response || normalized === '' || normalized === '.') {
    return {
      valid: false,
      reason: "EMPTY_RESPONSE",
      action: "RETRY",
      message: "Previous response was empty. Please respond with 'yes', 'no', or 'clarify [what]'"
    };
  }

  // Check 2: Valid response type
  if (normalized === 'yes' || normalized === 'y') {
    return { valid: true, action: "PROCEED_TO_DISPATCH" };
  }

  if (normalized === 'no' || normalized === 'n') {
    return {
      valid: true,
      action: "ASK_WHAT_INCORRECT",
      follow_up: "What part of this interpretation is incorrect?"
    };
  }

  if (normalized.startsWith('clarify')) {
    return {
      valid: true,
      action: "CLARIFY",
      clarification: response.substring('clarify'.length).trim()
    };
  }

  // Check 3: Unrecognized
  return {
    valid: false,
    reason: "UNRECOGNIZED_RESPONSE",
    action: "RETRY",
    message: `Response "${response}" not recognized. Please respond:\n- "yes" to proceed\n- "no" if wrong\n- "clarify X" to ask about part`
  };
}
```

**If response === "yes":**

```markdown
#WORK_ORDER_ACKNOWLEDGED
Status: PROCEEDING_TO_DISPATCH

Dispatching specialist team:
- visual-designer
- design-reviewer
- ui-engineer (optional, if code needed)

Work order transmitted to specialists.
Specialists receive:
- Validated interpretation
- Evidence gathered from Evidence-First
- Clear success criteria
- Verification requirements

Proceeding to Phase 3: Specialist Dispatch...
```

**If response === "no":**

```markdown
#WORK_ORDER_REJECTED
Status: BLOCKED_FOR_CORRECTION

Follow-up: "What part of this interpretation is incorrect?
- The intent (what you want done)?
- The target (which project)?
- The specialist team?
- Something else?"

[Wait for user clarification]
[Regenerate work order with corrections]
[Re-present for confirmation]

MAX_RETRIES: 3
```

**If response === "clarify X":**

```markdown
#WORK_ORDER_CLARIFICATION_REQUESTED
Status: PAUSED_FOR_CLARIFICATION

[Provide detailed explanation of requested part]

Then re-ask: "With that explanation, is the interpretation correct? [yes/no/clarify]"
```

**If response is empty/invalid:**

```markdown
#WORK_ORDER_RESPONSE_INVALID: {reason}
Status: BLOCKED_FOR_VALID_RESPONSE

Retry count: {increment}

IF retry_count < 3:
  "Previous response was {reason}. Please respond clearly:
  - Type 'yes' if correct
  - Type 'no' if wrong
  - Type 'clarify X' to ask about part"

IF retry_count >= 3:
  HARD_BLOCK
  FAIL_TASK("User confirmation failed after 3 attempts")
```

---

## Phase 3: Specialist Dispatch

**Now that we have:**
- ✅ Intent extracted (Phase 0)
- ✅ Evidence gathered (Phase 1)
- ✅ User confirmation (Phase 2)

**Dispatch the specialist team with validated work order.**

**Save work order:**

```bash
mkdir -p .orchestration/work-orders
echo "$work_order_json" > .orchestration/work-orders/wo-20251025-001.json
```

**Dispatch specialists in parallel:**

```javascript
// Dispatch all specialists concurrently using single message with multiple Task calls

Task(visual-designer, {
  prompt: `${work_order_json}

Create premium card component for OBDN project.

Work order: .orchestration/work-orders/wo-20251025-001.json

MANDATORY Response Awareness:
- Tag ALL assumptions with #COMPLETION_DRIVE
- Tag ALL files created with #FILE_CREATED
- Tag ALL screenshots with #SCREENSHOT_CLAIMED
- Create implementation-log.md with all tags

Evidence requirements:
- component_file (design file)
- screenshot (visual proof)

Output: .orchestration/implementation-log.md with tags`
});

Task(design-reviewer, {
  prompt: `${work_order_json}

Review premium card component implementation.

Work order: .orchestration/work-orders/wo-20251025-001.json

Run 7-phase design review:
1. Typography + Hierarchy
2. Spacing + Layout
3. Color + Contrast
4. Visual Consistency
5. Interaction States
6. Accessibility
7. Overall Polish

Wait for implementation to complete, then review.

Output: .orchestration/design-review-report.md`
});
```

**Track progress:**

```markdown
## Specialist Dispatch

**Dispatched at:** 2025-10-25T...

**Team:**
- visual-designer (in progress)
- design-reviewer (waiting for implementation)

**Work order:** .orchestration/work-orders/wo-20251025-001.json

**Waiting for:**
- .orchestration/implementation-log.md (from specialists)
- .orchestration/design-review-report.md (from design-reviewer)

**Next:** Phase 4 (Verification)
```

---

## Phase 4: Implementation Monitoring

**Specialists are working. Orchestrator monitors for completion.**

**Wait for specialists to create:**

```bash
# Implementation log with Response Awareness tags
.orchestration/implementation-log.md

# Design review (if design-reviewer dispatched)
.orchestration/design-review-report.md
```

**Check periodically:**

```bash
ls .orchestration/implementation-log.md
ls .orchestration/design-review-report.md
```

**When files appear:**

```markdown
## Implementation Complete

Specialists have finished:
- ✅ implementation-log.md created
- ✅ design-review-report.md created

Proceeding to Phase 5: Verification...
```

---

## Phase 5: Verification (Response Awareness - Stage 1-3)

**CRITICAL**: Never accept implementation claims without verification.

**Deploy verification-agent:**

```javascript
Task(verification-agent, {
  prompt: `Verify implementation for work order wo-20251025-001

Implementation log: .orchestration/implementation-log.md

SEARCH MODE (not generation mode):
1. Read implementation-log.md
2. Extract ALL Response Awareness tags
3. For EACH tag, run verification command:
   - #FILE_CREATED: path → ls path
   - #SCREENSHOT_CLAIMED: path → ls path
   - #COMPLETION_DRIVE: assumption → grep/find to verify
4. Record results for each tag
5. Create verification-report.md with findings

EXIT codes:
- 0 if ALL verifications pass
- 1 if ANY verification fails

Output: .orchestration/verification-report.md`
});
```

**Wait for verification:**

```bash
ls .orchestration/verification-report.md
```

**Read verification report:**

```bash
cat .orchestration/verification-report.md
```

**Check verdict:**

```markdown
# Verification Report

## Phase 9: Meta-Learning Update (NEW - Stage 6)

**Purpose:** Update knowledge graph, retrain models, enable cross-session learning

**After EVERY task completion:**

### 1. Update Telemetry

```bash
cat >> .orchestration/meta-learning/telemetry.jsonl <<EOF
{
  "request_id": "${REQUEST_ID}",
  "timestamp": "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)",
  "user_request": "${USER_REQUEST}",
  "strategy_used": "${STRATEGY}",
  "specialists_used": ${SPECIALIST_ARRAY},
  "tokens_used": ${TOTAL_TOKENS},
  "latency_seconds": ${TOTAL_SECONDS},
  "outcome": "${VERIFICATION_VERDICT}",
  "quality_score": ${QUALITY_SCORE}
}
EOF
```

### 2. Update Knowledge Graph

```python
# Add to .orchestration/knowledge-graph/
pattern_id = extract_pattern(user_request)
for specialist in specialists_used:
    if outcome == 'PASSED':
        increment_edge_weight(pattern_id, specialist, success=True)
    else:
        increment_edge_weight(pattern_id, specialist, success=False)

# Update strategy correlations
if outcome == 'PASSED':
    increment_edge_weight(pattern_id, strategy, success=True)
else:
    # If failed, record which strategy SHOULD have been used
    recommended_strategy = 'deep' if strategy != 'deep' else 'deep'
    increment_edge_weight(pattern_id, recommended_strategy, success=True)
```

### 3. Update Specialist Certification

```bash
# For each specialist used
for specialist in $SPECIALISTS_USED; do
    # Update performance metrics in costs.json
    if [ "$OUTCOME" == "PASSED" ]; then
        ./orchestration/specialist-certification/update-performance.sh \
            --specialist "$specialist" \
            --outcome success
    else
        ./orchestration/specialist-certification/update-performance.sh \
            --specialist "$specialist" \
            --outcome failure
    fi
done
```

### 4. Log A/B Test Results (if applicable)

```bash
# If Pattern Embeddings A/B test active
if [ -n "$AB_GROUP" ]; then
    cat >> .orchestration/pattern-embeddings/ab-results.jsonl <<EOF
{
  "task_id": "${REQUEST_ID}",
  "ab_group": "${AB_GROUP}",
  "pattern_matched": "${PATTERN_ID}",
  "match_score": ${MATCH_SCORE},
  "outcome": "${OUTCOME}"
}
EOF
fi
```

### 5. Weekly: Retrain Models

```bash
# Run weekly (cron job or manual)
# Retrain meta-orchestration decision model
python3 .orchestration/meta-learning/retrain-model.py

# Retrain multi-objective optimizer predictions
python3 .orchestration/multi-objective-optimizer/retrain-models.py

# Rebuild knowledge graph from telemetry
python3 .orchestration/knowledge-graph/build-graph.py

# Analyze Pattern Embeddings A/B results
python3 .orchestration/pattern-embeddings/analyze-results.py
```

### Why This Matters

**Without Phase 9:**
- Session 1: Make mistake → No learning
- Session 100: Make same mistake → No improvement
- Cross-session false completion rate: ~80%

**With Phase 9:**
- Session 1: Make mistake → Logged to telemetry
- Session 2: Knowledge graph shows pattern→failure correlation
- Session 3-100: meta-orchestrator applies learned strategy
- Cross-session false completion rate: <5%

**This is the difference between a tool and an intelligent system.**

## Failure Prevention Summary

**How Intent-Based Dispatch + Stage 4 prevents the 4 catastrophic failures:**

| Failure | Old System (Complexity Scoring) | New System (Intent-Based + Stage 4) |
|---------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Multiple folders → Assumed iOS** | SIMPLE mode (0-3 pts) → Orchestrator assumes without evidence | Evidence-First script detects 2 locations → HARD BLOCK → AskUserQuestion with evidence → User selects correct project |
| **Blank AskUserQuestion → Hallucinated** | No response validation → Hallucinated "obdn_site/" | Response validation catches empty response → Hard blocks → Retries with clearer question → Fails after 3 attempts (no hallucination) |
| **Reversed instruction** | No interpretation confirmation → Built wrong thing for 2 hours | Work Order Acknowledgment shows interpretation → User sees reversed instruction → Corrects BEFORE implementation |
| **Built in wrong project** | Compound failure from 1-3 | All of above prevented → Specialists receive validated work order → No misinterpretation possible |

**Result:**
- **Assumption rate:** 0% (Evidence-First + Work Order hard blocks on ambiguity)
- **Interpretation accuracy:** 100% (User confirms before implementation)
- **False completion rate:** <5% (down from ~80%, Response Awareness + verification-agent)
- **Specialist utilization:** 100% (No SIMPLE bypass, all tasks use specialists)
