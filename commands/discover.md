# /discover - Browse Design Collections (Fallback)

**PURPOSE**: Browse curated design collections to find industry examples when you DON'T have specific design references.

**‚ö†Ô∏è WHEN TO USE THIS:**
- Triggered automatically by `/concept` when user selects "Browse design collections"
- You need industry examples but have NO specific refs
- You want to see how others solved similar problems

**‚ö†Ô∏è WHEN NOT TO USE THIS:**
- You have specific design refs ‚Üí Use `/design` instead
- You have codebase examples ‚Üí Use `/concept` with "Search codebase"
- You just want to explore personal taste ‚Üí Use `/inspire` instead

**This is a FALLBACK tool** - slower and broader than `/design`, use only when needed.

**EXPECTED OUTCOME:**
1. Browse design collections with chrome-devtools MCP (visual browsing)
2. Take viewport screenshots of relevant examples
3. Save screenshots to `~/.claude/design-inspiration/[category]/` (global gallery)
4. Analyze screenshots with vision to extract aesthetic principles
5. Create discovery report with actionable design principles

**CRITICAL:** Must use visual browsing (screenshots + vision analysis), not just WebFetch text parsing.

## Project Context

**What are we building?**
$ARGUMENTS

If no arguments provided, ask user:
- What are you building?
- What's the aesthetic goal? (sophisticated, minimal, data-rich, etc.)
- What industry/category? (health, enterprise, consumer, etc.)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Relationship to Project Design Systems

**IMPORTANT HIERARCHY:**

```
Project Design System (RULES)
    ‚Üì
    Takes precedence over
    ‚Üì
/discover Examples (INSPIRATION)
```

### What /discover Provides

**Visual inspiration and aesthetic direction:**
- How elegant sites in your industry look
- What patterns work for your use case
- How to create sophistication and delight
- What emotional tone successful examples achieve

**These examples show WHAT WORKS in your category.**

### What /discover Does NOT Provide

**/discover examples do NOT replace:**
- ‚ùå Your project's font families
- ‚ùå Your project's color palette
- ‚ùå Your project's spacing system
- ‚ùå Your project's component styles
- ‚ùå Any hard rules in your project's design system guide

### How to Use Examples Correctly

**Correct Workflow:**
1. **FIRST**: Understand your project design system (fonts, colors, spacing)
2. **SECOND**: Run /discover to find examples in your category
3. **THIRD**: Extract PRINCIPLES from examples (not specific implementations)
4. **FOURTH**: Apply those principles WITHIN your project's design system

**Example - Learning from Stripe:**
- ‚úÖ CORRECT: "Stripe uses generous whitespace and clear hierarchy" (principle)
  - Implement generous whitespace with YOUR spacing system (var(--space-16))
  - Implement hierarchy with YOUR typography system (Domaine Sans Display, etc.)
- ‚ùå WRONG: "Stripe uses Inter font at 16px on white background"
  - Don't copy Inter if your system uses Domaine Sans Display
  - Don't copy white background if your system uses #0c051c dark

**Example - Learning from Linear:**
- ‚úÖ CORRECT: "Linear makes roadmap the hero with timeline visualization" (principle)
  - Create timeline visualization with YOUR components and colors
- ‚ùå WRONG: "Linear uses these exact hex colors and font sizes"
  - Don't copy their color palette if you have your own

**Example - Learning from Apple:**
- ‚úÖ CORRECT: "Apple uses restraint, showing one key message at a time" (principle)
  - Apply progressive disclosure with YOUR design system
- ‚ùå WRONG: "Apple uses San Francisco font"
  - Don't introduce San Francisco if your system has different fonts

### When Examples Conflict with Your Design System

**If an example uses something that contradicts your design system:**

1. **Extract the PRINCIPLE, not the implementation**
   - Example uses light background? ‚Üí Principle: "clear, uncluttered canvas"
   - Your system has dark background ‚Üí Apply same principle with dark palette

2. **Adapt the pattern to your constraints**
   - Example uses specific font? ‚Üí Why does it work? (hierarchy, readability)
   - Apply same hierarchy with YOUR authorized fonts

3. **Use /clarify if truly stuck**
   - Example demonstrates something valuable
   - But implementation requires design system change
   - Ask user if design system should be updated

### Examples of Correct Discovery

**Medical Protocol Page Discovery:**
```
/discover medical protocol with timeline and data

‚Üí Finds: Stripe Docs (technical content), Notion (information density)
‚Üí Extracts: "Progressive disclosure, scannable cards, timeline as hero"
‚Üí Applies: Create timeline with YOUR gold accent (#C9A961), YOUR fonts
‚Üí Result: Beautiful protocol page using YOUR design system
```

**Landing Page Discovery:**
```
/discover sophisticated health/wellness landing

‚Üí Finds: Vaayu (minimal elegance), MOHEIM (dark sophistication)
‚Üí Extracts: "Restraint, one focal point, generous spacing"
‚Üí Applies: Hero section with YOUR dark background, YOUR typography
‚Üí Result: Sophisticated landing using YOUR design system
```

### Summary

**What /discover teaches:** WHAT works aesthetically in your industry/category

**What it does NOT replace:** The specific design system rules for your project

**Always:** Extract principles from examples, implement with your design system

**Never:** Copy fonts, colors, spacing values just because an example uses them

---

## Phase 2: Browse Collections

### For Each Relevant Collection

**Read collection documentation:**
```
Read ~/.claude/design-inspiration/COLLECTIONS.md
```

**Extract browsing instructions for each collection:**

#### AREA 17
- URL: https://area17.com/
- Filter by industry vertical matching project
- Look for case studies in relevant sector

#### Bento Grids
- URL: https://bentogrids.com/
- Filter by theme (dark/light)
- Separate UI vs. graphic examples
- Real implementations: Vercel, Linear, Framer

---

## Phase 3: Active Browsing & Selection

**For each collection, WebFetch to explore:**

```
WebFetch collection URLs with prompt:
"Find examples relevant to [project description]. Look for:
- [Industry-specific characteristics]
- [Layout pattern needed]
- [Aesthetic goals]

List 3-5 most relevant examples with:
- Name/title
- URL
- Why it's relevant to this project
- What specific techniques to study"
```

**Example for medical protocol page:**

```
WebFetch https://area17.com/ with:
"Find examples in Health and life sciences category relevant to medical protocol reference pages.
Look for:
- Medical/pharmaceutical data presentation
- Timeline or protocol visualization
- Information-dense but scannable layouts
- Sophisticated, professional aesthetic

List 3-5 relevant examples with URLs and relevance explanation."
```

---

## Phase 3: Visual Browsing with Browser MCP (REQUIRED)

**CRITICAL:** /discover MUST use visual browsing, not just WebFetch text analysis.

### Browser Automation Workflow:

**For each site in COLLECTIONS.md:**

1. **Navigate** to the URL
2. **Wait** for page load (2-3 seconds)
3. **Take viewport screenshot** (NOT fullPage - causes timeouts)
4. **Save screenshot** to `~/.claude/design-inspiration/[category]/`
5. **Analyze with vision** to extract aesthetic principles

### Screenshot Best Practices:

```javascript
// Use viewport screenshots (faster, no timeout)
chrome-devtools - take_screenshot (fullPage: false)

// If timeout occurs, reduce viewport size
chrome-devtools - set_viewport (width: 1280, height: 800)

// Save to global inspiration gallery
Save screenshot to: ~/.claude/design-inspiration/[category]/[sitename].png
```

### Example: Browsing Aspirational Excellence

```
1. Navigate to https://www.vaayu.tech/
2. Wait 3s for load
3. Take viewport screenshot
4. Save to ~/.claude/design-inspiration/landing/vaayu.png
5. Analyze screenshot with vision:
   - What creates emotional resonance?
   - How does spacing create sophistication?
   - What typography creates premium feel?
   - How is restraint used as design principle?

6. Repeat for MOHEIM, DeepJudge, Fey, Endex
```

### Category Mapping:

- **Aspirational Excellence** ‚Üí `landing/`
- **Protocol/Data pages** ‚Üí `protocols/`
- **UI Components** ‚Üí `components/`
- **Interactions** ‚Üí `interactions/`
- **Typography examples** ‚Üí `typography/`

**For CSS Design Awards:**
```
1. Navigate to https://cssdesignawards.com/
2. Browse Winners or Nominees section
3. Screenshot individual winning sites
4. Look for data visualization / information architecture
```

**For SiteInspire:**
```
1. Navigate to https://www.siteinspire.com/
2. Use filters: Style + Type + Subject
3. Screenshot filtered results
4. Capture examples that match project needs
```

**For Bento Grids:**
```
1. Navigate to https://bentogrids.com/
2. Filter by dark/light theme
3. Filter by UI vs graphic
4. Screenshot relevant grid examples
```

**Benefits of Browser Automation:**
- Can browse JavaScript-heavy sites
- Take screenshots for vision analysis
- Interact with filters and navigation
- Capture actual rendered designs

### If No Browser MCP Available:

Fall back to WebFetch for text-based analysis of collection pages.

---

## Phase 4: Analyze Screenshots with Vision

**After capturing screenshots, ANALYZE them:**

For each screenshot saved to the inspiration gallery:

```
Read ~/.claude/design-inspiration/[category]/[sitename].png with vision
```

**Vision Analysis Questions:**

1. **FIRST IMPRESSION:**
   - What immediately catches the eye?
   - How does it feel? (sophisticated, warm, technical, elegant)

2. **LAYOUT & HIERARCHY:**
   - How is information organized?
   - What's the visual flow?
   - How does spacing create clarity?
   - What creates breathing room vs. cramping?

3. **TYPOGRAPHY:**
   - What fonts/scale create personality?
   - How does type hierarchy work?
   - What creates emphasis?

4. **COLOR & MATERIAL:**
   - Color palette and usage
   - Background treatments
   - Depth/layering techniques (gradients, shadows, blur)
   - How is restraint used?

5. **AESTHETIC SOPHISTICATION:**
   - What makes this feel premium/sophisticated?
   - How is restraint used as design principle?
   - What creates emotional resonance?
   - What invisible craft creates polish?

6. **TECHNIQUES TO EXTRACT:**
   - Specific spacing patterns (e.g., "80px between sections")
   - Typography scales
   - Color accent usage
   - Material depth techniques
   - Progressive disclosure patterns

7. **APPLICABLE TO YOUR PROJECT:**
   - How to adapt this approach
   - What to avoid
   - Core principle to apply

## Example: Medical Protocol Page

```
User: /discover medical protocol reference page

Phase 1: Understanding
  Project: Medical protocol reference page
  Industry: Health/Medical
  Pattern: Timeline/protocol visualization
  Aesthetic: Sophisticated, professional, scannable

Phase 2: Collections to Browse
  ‚Üí AREA 17: Health and life sciences
  ‚Üí CSS Design Awards: Data visualization
  ‚Üí Bento Grids: IF appropriate for feature cards
  ‚Üí SiteInspire: Medical + Minimal

Phase 3: Active Browsing
  WebFetch AREA 17 health category
  ‚Üí Found: Pharmaceutical dashboard example
  ‚Üí Found: Medical research data visualization

  WebFetch CSS Design Awards medical
  ‚Üí Found: Hospital website with protocol display
  ‚Üí Found: Health tech platform with timelines

Phase 4: Discovery Report
  üìã Found 5 relevant examples:
  1. Pharmaceutical Data Dashboard (AREA 17)
  2. Medical Timeline Viz (CSS Design Awards)
  3. [etc...]

Phase 5: Vision Analysis (if screenshots)
  üî¨ Analyzing pharmaceutical dashboard:
  - Timeline as hero element
  - Compact cards for compound info
  - Progressive disclosure pattern
  - Spacing: 32px between phases (not 24px)
  - Cards: 20px padding minimum

Phase 6: Extract Patterns
  üé® COMMON ACROSS EXAMPLES:
  - Timeline/protocol is primary focus
  - Supporting info in compact cards
  - Progressive disclosure (don't show everything)
  - Generous spacing for medical content
  - Sophisticated color restraint

Phase 7: Application Plan
  üìê FOR YOUR INJURY PROTOCOL PAGE:

  Layout: Timeline-first (like anti-aging page)
  - Horizontal timeline as hero
  - Phase cards below, compact
  - Progressive disclosure for compound details

  Spacing: 32px between timeline phases
  Cards: 20px padding minimum

  Should I implement with these principles?
```

---

## Integration with Inspiration Gallery

**After discovery, optionally save examples:**

```
Would you like to save these examples to your inspiration gallery?

If yes:
1. Download/screenshot examples
2. Save to ~/.claude/design-inspiration/protocols/
3. Name descriptively (e.g., "area17-pharma-timeline.png")
4. These become permanent references for /inspire
```

---

## Critical Rules

### DO:
- ‚úÖ Browse multiple collections for comprehensive view
- ‚úÖ Use vision analysis if screenshots available
- ‚úÖ Extract PRINCIPLES not just aesthetics
- ‚úÖ Explain HOW to adapt, not just WHAT to copy
- ‚úÖ Show browsing strategy before diving in
- ‚úÖ Synthesize patterns across examples

### DON'T:
- ‚ùå Just list URLs without relevance explanation
- ‚ùå Copy designs without understanding WHY they work
- ‚ùå Skip vision analysis if examples are accessible
- ‚ùå Browse randomly - be strategic based on project
- ‚ùå Forget to connect findings back to user's project

---

## When to Use /discover

**‚úÖ USE WHEN:**
- Triggered by `/concept` when user selects "Browse design collections"
- User has NO specific design refs but needs industry examples
- Need to see current trends in specific industry (health, fintech, AI, etc.)
- Want examples for specific pattern (timeline, dashboard, protocol, etc.)
- Looking for inspiration for specific aesthetic goal

**‚ùå DON'T USE WHEN:**
- User HAS specific design refs ‚Üí Use `/design` instead (faster, conversational)
- Codebase has similar work ‚Üí Use `/concept` with "Search codebase"
- User wants to explore personal taste ‚Üí Use `/inspire` instead
- You already have clear reference patterns ‚Üí No need to browse
- Just need to execute existing design ‚Üí Skip discovery entirely

**DECISION TREE:**

```
Need design direction?
    ‚îú‚îÄ Have specific refs? ‚Üí /design (5-10 min, conversational)
    ‚îú‚îÄ Have codebase examples? ‚Üí /concept "Search codebase" (10-15 min)
    ‚îú‚îÄ Have NO refs? ‚Üí /discover (20-30 min, broad search) ‚Üê YOU ARE HERE
    ‚îî‚îÄ Just exploring taste? ‚Üí /inspire (15-20 min, monthly)
```

**RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER COMMANDS:**

- **/inspire**: Global taste, personal aesthetic (monthly, gallery-based)
- **/design**: Project direction with YOUR refs (per-project, conversational)
- **/discover**: Fallback when you have NO refs (rare, broad search)
- **/concept**: Orchestrates all three (decides which tool to use)

---

## Summary

**/discover is the FALLBACK for when you have NO refs:**

**The Process:**
1. Understand project (industry, pattern, aesthetic)
2. Map to relevant collections (CSS Awards, SiteInspire, etc.)
3. Browse strategically (WebFetch collections)
4. Find 3-5 relevant examples
5. Analyze with vision (if possible)
6. Extract common patterns
7. Create application plan
8. Optionally save to inspiration gallery

**Comparison to other commands:**

| Command | Purpose | When to Use | Speed | Frequency |
|---------|---------|-------------|-------|-----------|
| `/inspire` | Build personal taste | Understand aesthetic preferences | 15-20 min | Monthly |
| `/design` | Project direction | You HAVE specific refs | 5-10 min | Per project |
| `/discover` | Find examples | You have NO refs | 20-30 min | Rare (fallback) |
| `/concept` | Orchestrate all three | Starting design work | Varies | Per design task |

**When to use /discover:**
- Only when triggered by `/concept` OR
- You explicitly have NO refs and need industry examples

**Result:** Curated industry examples with extracted principles for THIS project (slower than `/design` but broader).
